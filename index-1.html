                        <p>
Liverpool FC is my football club. Palakkad is my beautiful home town in Kerala, India.
</p>

<p>
I had a dream.
</p>

<p>
Liverpool FC came to Palakkad to play a football game. Sadio Mane started the
game on bench, but he chose to stand with the fans. A confident young boy was
standing next to him in the stadium.  Naturally, they became friends.
Unforeseen, as is usually the case with nature, the game was cancelled few
minutes into it.  I asked Sadio, “Will you play football with us in my school?“
He said yes. So I took him to Navodaya Vidyalaya, Palakkad, the best school in
the world. I introduced Sadio to my friends and they all were ready for a game.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
<img src="galleries/NavodayaGround.JPG" alt="nil"></p>
<hr>
<p>
Sadio fell in love with the ground the moment he saw it. Western ghats in the
backdrop and the amazing Palakkadan wind made him whisper: “This is where I want
to play day in day out”. Sadio played in my team's attack and I played in the
midfield. When my goalkeeper played a simple ball to me, I looked up the field
and saw Sadio making the run. With my barefoot, I sliced the ball and it was
airborne. Seconds later, that touch by Sadio, and the finish, the ball was in
the back of the net. The trend continued, he made those runs, and I sent him
through on the goal.  We won!
</p>

<p>
After the post match handshake and hug, Sadio asked me: “Why don’t you come to
Melwood some day?”  in French obviously. I smiled, and said “Oui, I will
try. Merci beaucoup”.  Sadio flew back to England.  On the plane, he spoke to a
man called Jurgen Klopp and a week later, I got a call from Liverpool FC, the
best football club in the world.
</p>

<p>
I landed in John Lennon airport. Imagine all the people, waiting for my arrival.
I reached Melwood, Liverpool FC's training ground.  Sadio introduced me to his
friends. Virgil was taller than me.  Trent is younger than me. Robbo warned me
about Millie's humour sense.  Mo's English was better than mine. I gave Ali a
chocolate and he kept it. I told Bobby he is my favourite player. The boss gave
me hug and said welcome. I was home.
</p>

<p>
I wore boots for evening's training session. Sadio told the boss that he wanted
me to play in his side. I scored one, assisted twice, made a goal saving tackle
and broke my ankle.
</p>

<p>
Hendo lifted the ball onto Mo's path, who cut it back to Bobby, who nonchalantly
flicked it into the space behind Virgil.  I was too quick for the big man. Blink
of an eye, I slotted the ball past Adrian and copied a Bobby celebration.  Then
Allison played a simple ball to me, I looked up the field and saw Sadio making
the run.  I sliced the ball and it was airborne.  Seconds later, that touch by
Sadio and the finish, the ball was in the back of the net. The second assist
followed a neat link up play between Bobby, Mo, Sadio and Me.  Bobby's no look
finish met my cross at the far post. Jurgen's celebration to that was wild.
</p>

<p>
I might have kicked the wall too hard. That's how I woke up with a broken ankle,
but it was definitely worth the dream. <br></p>

<hr>
<p>
Mighty mountains, I saw its curves and peaks,<br>
Up above and far away, amongst clouds and skies.<br>
Through pathless woods, I shall climb to the top,<br>
A strange voice inside my head, but I did not stop.<br></p>

<p>
First came the rain, making my feet wet,<br>
Then came the sun, making my brow sweat.<br>
Pain building in body, but I couldn't care less,<br>
Then I crossed a line, that made the trees jealous<br></p>

<p>
Slippery stones, my mind must decide quick,<br>
The next crucial step in this trek.<br>
For the wrong choice could be as fatal,<br>
As a life, with no adventure to tell.<br></p>

<p>
Alas, I saw the yellow tent by the riverside,<br>
In a valley like a silver necklace on a bride.<br>
Stretched my shape, and washed my face,<br>
With water so cold, that set my wits ablaze.<br></p>

<p>
Twilight flirted with day and night,<br>
Sky blushed as it turned orange, bright.<br>
Adios, I am done for the day, said the setting Sun.<br>
'See you on the other side' was Earth's cunning pun.<br></p>

<p>
The river carried mountain's letter to the sea.<br>
The poem rhymed words of passionate love to me.<br>
Fate, they cannot unite; divided by an invisible wall.<br>
Faith! the mountain awaited the next rainfall.<br></p>

<p>
I looked up, now the canvas was painted black,<br>
A full moon and a thousand splendid suns smiled back.<br>
I walked for long, forlorn, with a mind full of peace.<br>
Mighty mountains, I loved its curves and peaks.<br></p>

<b><i>What happened?</i></b>
</p>

<p>
I was reading a book and suddenly heard a loud noise from outside.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Can you please elaborate?</i></b>
</p>

<p>
That's what sir, BANG!, and seconds later, a second BANG.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Will you be able to recreate your evening till the incident?</i></b>
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir. Yesterday I came back late from work to attend two more late evening
meetings. Ms. Elusive Luck's birthday, both meetings got cancelled at my
arrival. So, I practised music for what I thought was an hour.  Sir, It was a
good workout, and by the end I was sweating and shivering from forehead to
heels. I wrapped the set, and was hungrily wandering indoors.  That's when i saw
the most beautiful thing on my study table. A banana!  Who keeps a banana on a
study table, sir? Well, I did. Yesterday morning.  Sync sir, Unbelievable.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Alright, then what?</i></b>
</p>

<p>
Sir, I thought of cooking dinner. Dosa in my mind, I found couple of duck eggs
in the fridge. 'Egg Dosa' creeped, sorry, crept into my head. I fetched Dosa
batter and eggs to the warmth outside. Roasted some curry leaves, and ground
them with chillies into a lush green paste. Fried some Coin Pappads as well.
</p>

<p>
An eerie silence lurked in the kitchen while I was chopping onions. I added salt
and a pinch of turmeric to the onions. Then I introduced our dear eggs to Madame
la Guillotine, CRACK! its viscous yellow head crashed into the bowl.  I stirred
a motley mixture with all that. When the pan on the stove started whispering to
the winds I threw a water blanket over it. The pan hissed and shot
sodium-in-water tantrums at me. I calmly slid the hot bubbling bubbles into the
sink. Then I painted a solar system on the pan with batter.  The system had to
be perfect. A subtle press in the center followed by concentric Sufi
whirling. It must spread into a round Gaussian distribution and scatter a
Brownian motion of batter pores. The pores would channel the steam upwards,
cooking the layers above en route its itinerary. Then, I sprayed oil, and
smeared the lush green paste on top of the maturing Dosa.  Few seconds later, I
massaged the duck egg mash on the green pasture.  Juxtaposition, hitherto
unrealistic, was accomplished.
</p>

<p>
Sir, I flipped the Dosa, and waited for the other side to get cooked, flipped it
again, and kept the Dosa aside. Made one more Dosa like that, sir. Later, I ate
both Dosas with Maple syrup, Chammanthi Podi, and Coin pappads sir.  
Sync sir, Unbelievable.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>What is a Chammanthi podi?</i></b> <br>
Sir, this is not the appropriate time sir. Maybe later.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Then?</i></b>
</p>

<p>
I had a pear, drank 350ml of water, brushed my teeth, wrote a blog post, washed
my legs, and went to bed. I continued reading the book "To kill a mockingbird",
when suddenly heard a loud noise from outside sir.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Is that it?</i></b><br>
Yes sir.
</p>

<p>
<i>Well, write down your address and phone number. You will have to come to the</i>
<i>police station when called upon, to give your statement about yesterday's</i>
<i>incident.</i>
</p>

<p>
Done deal sir. Many peace.

The sky was clear and the occasion was auspicious, all set to witness the unwitnessed. 
</p>

<p>
<i>The Misogynist-Feminist wedding!</i>
</p>

<p>
The cool breeze from the east moved her jet black hair to his teeth.
He stopped grinning at once. 
No one was invited to their wedding, yet they were facing a sea of 
willing crowd to this fictional reality. When the news was whispered 
to them on a hot summer day, they were all <i>thunderstruck</i>, 
and screamed in unison, "What the"!
</p>

<p>
The ceremony began with frowns. The crowd murmured incessantly.  They argued the
male was feminist, and female misogynist; said it was a marriage made in paradox
not paradise.  When the couple vowed to make each other successful, old women in
the crowd lifted their hands to mouth in pure shock.  Maybe, the crowd was not
ready for this, it was way ahead of their time.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the <i>Cardinals of language</i> convened in a brand new library.
<i>Grammar goons</i> waited outside with safety pins and clown hats.  They were angry
at the innate irony of the scheme, thought it to be a joke; their honor and
semantics being dragged through mud. A lesson must be taught.  The infidels
should be ostracized from dictionaries at the least. At last, the convention
decided to punish them with the <i>punishment-that-shall-never-be-given</i>.
</p>

<p>
A huge drama followed, and the couple lived happily ever-after.

<p>
<i>ANNAMMA</i>. Yes.<br></p>

<p>
<i>EARNEST</i>. It is a comedy movie.<br></p>

<p>
<i>ANNAMMA</i>. I know. But there is no laughter. Humour is hiding.<br></p>

<p>
<i>EARNEST</i>. Ridiculous, ridiculous. The script was hilarious. I wrote it.<br></p>

<p>
<i>ANNAMMA</i>. They are just silent. There is a powerful sound vacuum.<br></p>

<p>
<i>EARNEST</i>. That's impossible. I remember it was funny. Didn't it tickle your funny bone?<br></p>

<p>
<i>ANNAMMA</i>. Yes. It did tickle me.<br></p>

<p>
<i>EARNEST</i>. The actors also were hysterical during the filming. They had the time of their life doing what I told them to do.<br></p>

<p>
<i>ANNAMMA</i>. Right Sir. They did laugh their bottoms up.<br></p>

<p>
<i>EARNEST</i>. Why are the audience such cretins?<br></p>

<p>
<i>ANNAMMA</i>. I don't know. But some of them even left the theatre in between the show.<br></p>

<p>
<i>EARNEST</i>. That's cold blooded comedy blasphemy!<br></p>

<p>
<i>ANNAMMA</i>. I couldn't take it as well. That's why I came out to tell you.<br></p>

<p>
<i>EARNEST</i>. Thanks Annamma. Let's get out of here. Where is our driver?<br></p>

<p>
<i>ANNAMMA</i>. I think he inside the hall watching the movie.<br></p>

<p>

<h2 id="org5a886a3"><code>Well</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5a886a3">
<p>
The idea is to create a blogging website hosted in <i>Github</i>, using a
static site generator software <i>Nikola</i>, with the help of <i>Python
virtual environment</i> and then write blog posts using <i>emacs org mode</i>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgac97b7c" class="outline-4">

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgac97b7c">

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>git</code> : <i>(British)</i> a foolish or worthless person

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, keeping that in mind:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a GitHub account with username 'bottle'</li>
<li>Create a repository with the following name:'bottle.github.io'</li>
<li>
<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Instructions</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once done this, GitHub will host your website in the following
address(URL) : <a href="https://bottle.github.io/">https://bottle.github.io/</a>
</p>

<p>
Clone(copy) this newborn repository into your local machine a.k.a
personal computer by using the following command:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://bottle.github.io/ <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/projects/bottle
</pre></div>

<p>
You will be adding blog posts in ~/projects/bottle directory and will
push them back to GitHub later.

<h2 id="org4a2509e"><code>Python Virtual Environment</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4a2509e">
<p>
If you haven't heard the news yet, Python is a programming
language and Python 3 is here to stay.
</p>

<p>
Python Virtual environment basically copies python scripts to create a
new workplace. You could install custom python packages specific to your
project. This means packages used for one project will not pollute
another project.
</p>

<p>
For e.g. if you wish to have a separate working environment for
cooking vegetables, where you don't want nikola to be installed, 
create a virtual environment called vegetables. 
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge4118bf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge4118bf">Virtual environment wrapper</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge4118bf">
<p>
Gift-wrapped python virtual environment commands.
For ease of use. No need to remember too many virtualenv commands.
</p>


<p>
Let "$HOME/virenvs" be our directory for all environments.

<div id="outline-container-org89f0c7d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org89f0c7d">Steps</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org89f0c7d">
<p>
Make sure you have pip (python package manager) installed in your machine.
And follow the steps :
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenvwrapper
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">WORKON_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/virenvs
<span class="nb">source</span> /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
mkvirtualenv bottle

add a .gitignore file to <code>$HOME/projects/bottle</code> folder with the
following content in it.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>*.py<span class="o">[</span>cod<span class="o">]</span>

<p>
commit this to git

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nikola init bottle
</pre></div>
<p>
Fill in the form that follows.
</p>

<p>
It should show a success message after form is filled.
Now, nikola will create a new folder called bottle inside
<code>$HOME/projects/bottle</code>, which is unnecessary. So move its contents to
<code>$HOME/projects/bottle</code> folder and delete the extra bottle.
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mv my_first_site/* .
rm -r my_first_site
</pre></div>


<p>
Your new site 'bottle' can be viewed either locally or globally(using
a new technology called internet). The latter will be done later.
</p>

<p>
To view your recently created site locally, 
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nikola build
nikola serve
</pre></div>

<p>
Open browser and enter <i>localhost:8000</i> in the URL bar !
</p>

<p>
To stop the localhost web service in the terminal hit Ctrl-c.

Every great software application is a file with some text in it and
<code>Emacs is a text file editor</code>

<p>
The best way to get started with Emacs is to follow its built-in
tutorial. Open Emacs and press Ctrl-h t. 
Emacs tastes best when customized. Help is available at <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/">using emacs</a>.

<p>
org-mode in itself is the biggest reason people fall in love with
Emacs so easily. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4">I like org mode introduction by Harry Schwartz</a>.

<p>
Two cool things in org-mode that I must mention:
