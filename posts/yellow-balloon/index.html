                <p>
The night, soothingly quiet, Poet awoke in her bed.<br>
Eyes wide, a story unsaid, raging in her head.<br>
She opened her book and started scribbling away,<br>
With hope that the memory of her dream would stay.<br></p>

<p>
Lying on a hammock she thought,<br>
About a piquant dream she caught.<br>
An unsaid story that she must tell,<br>
But out of her mind it suddenly fell.<br></p>

<p>
It was about a familiar young girl,<br>
Who wore a necklace made of pearl.<br>
Ah..! that curious world inside a crystal bowl,<br>
And indeed the villain who made the story whole!<br></p>

<p>
Enter Villain, with a yellow balloon in his hand,<br>
Seven feet tall, skinny lad was all tanned.<br>
With him he brought his own music band,<br>
Popular songs that it played were all banned.<br></p>

<p>
Yellow balloon hovered above his head like a halo,<br>
Her eyes twinkled as she went to say hello.<br>
Will you give me that yellow balloon I crave?<br>
Quid pro quo, the pearl necklace, that I will take to my grave.<br></p>

<p>
The necklace? no, no!<br>
Oh dear, why is that so?<br>
Because you’re the villain in this story!<br>
Yes, but villains are also part of history.<br></p>

<p>
No, I know, villains always lose in the end.<br>
Right you are! Here, take the balloon my friend.<br>
As she reached out for the balloon, he let it fly,<br>
Ha-ha! where's the fun in not letting it touch the sky.<br></p>

<p>
She woke up with a start, still lying on her hammock,<br>
The pearl necklace was planted safely on her neck.<br>
Opened her book and started scribbling away,<br>
With hope that the memory of her dream would stay.<br></p>

<p>
The night, soothingly quiet, is coming to its end,<br>
The poet now stood in her balcony facing the cold wind.<br>
Words rhyming on her book, Pearls shining on her neck,<br>
As she smiled at an yellow balloon that dawned up in the sky.<br></p>
