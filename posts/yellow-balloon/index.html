                <p>
The night, soothingly quiet, Poet awoke in her bed,<br>
A story emerged, an idea raged inside her head.<br>
She leapt to her desk, and started scribbling away,<br>
In hope that the memory of her dream would stay.<br></p>

<p>
Lying on a hammock she thought-thought,<br>
About last night’s dream that she caught.<br>
A story that she wanted to tell-tell,<br>
But out of her mind it suddenly fell.<br></p>

<p>
Something about a familiar young girl,<br>
Who wore a necklace made of pearl.<br>
Ah..! the curious world inside a crystal bowl,<br>
And indeed a villain to make the story whole!<br></p>

<p>
Enter the villain, with a yellow balloon in his hand,<br>
Seven feet tall, skinny lad was all tanned.<br>
With him he brought his own music band,<br>
That played popular songs which were banned.<br></p>

<p>
Yellow balloon hovered above his head like a halo,<br>
Her eyes twinkled as she went to say hello.<br>
Will you give me that yellow balloon that I crave?<br>
Quid pro quo the pearl necklace, I will take it to my grave.<br></p>

<p>
I will not give you the necklace.<br>
Is that so young lady? why? may I ask?<br>
Because you’re the villain in this story,<br>
Yes! but villains are also part of history.<br></p>

<p>
Don't villains invariably lose in the end?<br>
Right you are! here is your yellow balloon, my friend.<br>
She reached out for the balloon, and he let it fly,<br>
Hahahaa! where's the fun in not letting it touch the sky.<br></p>

<p>
She woke up with a start, still lying on her hammock,<br>
The pearl necklace planted safely on her neck.<br>
She slid into her chair, and started scribbling away,<br>
In hope that the memory of her dream would stay.<br></p>

<p>
The night, soothingly quiet, is coming to its end,<br>
As Poet looked outside the balcony, facing the wind.<br>
Words rhyming on her book; Pearl necklace on her neck,<br>
She smiled at an yellow balloon dawning up in the sky.<br></p>
