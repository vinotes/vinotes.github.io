"I don't think I'll be able to write!", she said.
The night is soothingly quiet as she lied on the bed,
Morpheus ushered her down to the world below,
Where her imagination opened to let creativity flow!

As she awoke in the morning, she was charged,
She had an idea, as a story from within emerged.
Her excitement knew no bounds as she scribbled away,
For she knew not how long the memory of her dream would stay!

Lying on the hammock she thought thought thought,
Of last night’s dream that she caught, caught caught.
A story that she wanted to tell tell tell,
But suddenly out of her mind it fell fell fell.

Ah... a paradise world inside a crystal bowl, 
Something about yummy food and a funny girl,
A necklace which she wore was made of pearl,
But a villain was necessary to make the story whole!

Enter the villain with a yellow balloon in his hand,
Six foot tall and a ripped body that is tanned.
With him he brought his music band,
Sang popular songs which were banned.

The villain had manners alike a Troll’s apathy,
But his yellow balloon was gorgeous like a halo.
A quote printed on the balloon meant child’s empathy,
Seeking it, she sprinted to the him to say hello.

Hello boredom, she said,
He replied
Hanji Madam, he replied.
Will you give me that yellow balloon that I crave, 
Yes, in return give me that pearl necklace, I will take it to my grave.

I will not give you the necklace.
Why will not you give the necklace?
Because you’re the villain of the story,
That I agree, villains are part of history.

I guess we are stuck in a deadlock.
Are you thinking what I am thinking 
Yes I’m, but I won’t race to mock.
Look, Do you want the balloon, youngling?

Yes, yes, yes. but I wont give the pearl.
Well then, here, take the yellow balloon girl.
She reached out for the balloon and he let it fly.
Hahahaha.. What’s the fun in ending if not let it touch the sky.


Thanks and Regards
Villain
