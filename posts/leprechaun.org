He said, "Ooh, maybe we should look for the pot of gold at the end of it".

What?

Oh my god! Have you not heard about Leprechauns?

Of course not.

Well, in Irish folklore, Leprechauns are mentioned as cunning supernatural
creatures sporting a red beard, green coat and a hat. They are cobblers and
part time pranksters, notorious for their practical jokes on the gullible.

Once upon a time, there lived a poor farmer with his wife. One day, when they
pulled the very last carrot from their farm, found a Leprechaun dangling at
the end of it. In exchange for its release, the Leprechaun granted them one
wish. The couple took a while to decide on the wish, and started to list out all
the things they wanted in life. Leprechaun identified this as a symptom of greed,
and played a cruel prank on the poor farmers. It said, maybe the pot of gold at
the end of the rainbow will solve all your problems. The couple went searching
after the elusive pot of gold. Moral(s) of the story: Be careful what you wish
for, You only get what you deserve, Success through shortcuts will not last
longer, etc.

Oh, wait. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the Irish National Quidditch
team's mascots were Leprechauns, weren't they?

Yes, indeed they were.

Bloody hell.

Would you like to hear about St. Patrick's day celebrations in Ireland?

No, thank you, I need to re-read the fourth book, cheers!
