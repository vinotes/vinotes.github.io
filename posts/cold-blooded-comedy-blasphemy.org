[The Director is waiting inside the car.]

[Enter Mrs. Annamma]

/ANNAMMA/. Earnest, my dear, they are not laughing.

/EARNEST/. What do you mean they aren't laughing? Did you hear them not laughing? 

/ANNAMMA/. Yes.

/EARNEST/. It is a comedy movie.

/ANNAMMA/. I know. But there is no laughter. Humour is hiding. 

/EARNEST/. Ridiculous, ridiculous. The script was hilarious. I wrote it.

/ANNAMMA/. They are just silent. There is a powerful sound vacuum.

/EARNEST/. That's impossible. I remember it was funny. Didn't it tickle your funny bone?

/ANNAMMA/. Yes. It did tickle me.

/EARNEST/. The actors also were hysterical during the filming. They had the time of their life doing what I told them to do.

/ANNAMMA/. Right Sir. They did laugh their bottoms up.

/EARNEST/. Why are the audience such cretins?

/ANNAMMA/. I don't know. But some of them even left the theatre in between the show.

/EARNEST/. That's cold blooded comedy blasphemy! 

/ANNAMMA/. I couldn't take it as well. That's why I came out to tell you.

/EARNEST/. Thanks Annamma. Let's get out of here. Where is our driver?

/ANNAMMA/. I think he inside the hall watching the movie.

/EARNEST/. Thank goodness, at least the boy has some sense of humour.

/ANNAMMA/. Here he comes. In his face, I see... satisfaction!

/EARNEST/. Wonderful, Wonderful!
**  SECOND ACT
 
*SCENE*

 ------------------------------------------------

[The Director and Assistant gets out of the car.]

[Enter Parthaa]


/EARNEST/. Partha, Did you enjoy it?

/PARTHAA/. Sir, it is Parthaa, not Partha.

/EARNEST/. Parthaa, Did you enjoy it?

/ANNAMMA/. Tell us, how was it?

/PARTHAA/. It was relaxing. Thanks for asking.

/EARNEST/. Thank God. All that not in vain.

/ANNAMMA/. Well done Earnest. Congratulations.

/EARNEST/. Thanks dear.

/ANNAMMA/. Parthaa, is it over already? I thought it went for another 30 minutes.

/PARTHAA/. Sorry what? No, I finished it quickly.

/ANNAMMA/. (exchanging look with Earnest) You finished it quickly...?

/EARNEST/. Were you not in the theatre?

/ANNAMMA/. Watching the movie?

/PARTHAA/. Oh, no.. no.. I was in the toilet.
