Curiouser and Curiouser gets life at every random decisions we make. I was under
the misapprehension that by not bothering to give a try at something I can be
assured to be bad at it. If these words were short and catchy, it would make it
my motto. Does that make any sense? Life is Schrodinger's cat all over again.

Bit of background, I moved to a different country to pursue the ever elusive
higher education. Call it the end of autumn madness, for I enrolled in drama
auditions at University's drama society. All I wanted was to experience an
audition, and mildly irritate the panel with uncouth improvisations. I
auditioned for the role of Guy Tree, a homeless person carelessly wandering into
a farm owned by two sisters. The sisters had inherited this farm from their
parents after their recent demise. Sisters adopt Guy Tree into their farm and
household and he helps them in managing the farm. A monologue of Guy Tree
reminiscing his past; living in a busy city with his parents and him wanting
peace and quiet. When he reach the farm which is extraordinarily quiet, he finds
the silence intolerable. Done. We will let you know in couple of days. Two days
later, I got a recall from the team.

Having no expectations is perhaps our courage to attempt out of the ordinary
deeds. Somebody identifying potential in us is the worst form of
scaremongering. Now, I was nervous because there were around 80 members who
auditioned for this. Majority of them belonged to related fields of study, like
Literature, Drama, Gender Studies, Film Studies etc. I was an Electrical
Engineer. Regardless of the outcome, I convinced myself to enjoy the
experience.

Freddie's character was Ben, brother of the two sisters running the farm. A
lengthy conversation between generally insecure yet extroverted Ben and
optimistic but introverted Guy was to be enacted for the recall auditions. After
practising couple of times, we went into the audition room. The panel were ready
when we are ready. The fifteen minutes I acted as Guy, I saw only Ben in Freddie
and an imaginary Ewe about to give birth in the corner of the room. The panel
members were invisible to me. I was Guy Tree for that short period.
I did get the part, but I definitely enjoyed the experience.
