Dear Listener,
</p>

<p>
The only way you can spoil a Wodehouse story is by not reading it.
</p>

<p>
Welcome to Hitchens' Razor.
</p>

<p>
What is the irresistible charm of a Wodehouse story on a teenage boy living in a
remote village on a mountainous high range in tropical south Asia? What's Jeeves
and Blandings Castle books doing there? This episode is about the English
language maestro P.G. Wodehouse - a glimpse specifically for foreigners to
Britain.
</p>

<p>
English has always been a confusing language for foreigners. Their struggle,
when studied along the semantics and phonetics of this enigmatic language
presents a satisfying conclusion that it is nothing but a mish-mash of
self-contradicting words and received paradoxical phrases devotedly practised
over multiple millennia. Its vocabulary thus enriched with 'stuff' borrowed,
stolen or sometimes grabbed from other places - just like the word 'grab', which
has now seemingly been inculcated into the cultural lexicon as an inappropriate
but accepted verb everywhere, most noticeably coffee shops. Why would you grab a
coffee? just take it, especially if you have paid for it. Anyway, the victim
languages, that is to say most of the foreign languages, albeit complex, are
often complete and superior to English - what you speak is what you write is
exactly what others read in other languages. Have you ever wondered why English
language cannot handle a genre like Magic Realism?
</p>

<p>
Yet, the language survived, it proliferated, and even ruled, why? Because, few
people accepted its frailties and went beyond them; they managed to put English
words in a certain order, which not just transformed the sentences and the
stories, but made the language itself irresistible to outsiders. At the perch of
that bunch of doyens is P.G. Wodehouse.
</p>

<p>
There are certain things that can only be experienced and not explained. To get
a novel right, an author needs to consummate four 'P's, says Stephen Fry: Place,
People, Plot, and Prose. The place is more or less unchanging in Wodehousian
tales - all set in 18th century England or New York . Perhaps, we could credit
him lucky to have had the friends, family, surroundings and upbringing for those
imperishable characters(People) he created. The plot, paraphrasing Wodehouse's
own words, "if you get the love story correct, then plot will follow". But, the
prose, that's what sets him apart. The way he puts one word after the other,
separated by those impeccable punctuation, and the interweaving of expanding
humour realised without any profanity, but with clever juxtaposition and play on
words and ideas in those lines leaves a literary equivalent of umami in reader's
mind. Nobody knows how he managed that. I am safe of not abusing the word
'genius' here.
</p>

<p>
I know what you are thinking listener: Well, that's all good, but there are
about a 100 books, where shall I begin? Whom should I acquaint with first? Is it
Bertie Wooster, Jeeves, Lord Emsworth, the Efficient Baxter, or PSmith with a
silent 'P', or all the overbearing aunties? Oh, please tell me where should I
begin?
</p>

<p>
Well, start at 'Something Fresh'.
</p>

<p>
It is the first book in Blandings Castle series. We are introduced to Blandings
Castle and Lord Emsworth, The Efficient Baxter, and a perfect love story.
Ehh… not between Emsworth and Baxter, but others in the story. Anyway, here
are few lines from the book 'Something Fresh', that might release you from
indecision:
</p>


<p>
"The sunshine of a fair spring morning fell graciously upon London town. It was
the sort of morning when air gives us a feeling of anticipation, a feeling that,
on a day like this, things surely cannot go joggling along in a the same dull
groove, a premonition that something romantic and exciting is about to happen to
us."
</p>

<p>
"Science with a thousand triumphs to her credit, has not yet succeeded in
discovering the correct reply for a young man to make who finds himself in the
appalling position of being apologised to by a pretty girl.
</p>

<p>
"They made poor old Percy look an absolute ass."
Well, Nature had done that already, but I'm bound to say they improved on
Nature's work. I should think your cousin Percy must have felt like a plucked
chicken."
</p>

<p>
"Trouble, after all, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder."
</p>

<p>
"Ashe was becoming conscious of an undercurrent of something not altogether
agreeable in the conversation. It lacked the gay ease of their first
interview. He was not apprehensive lest she might have guessed his secret."
</p>

<p>
"One does not fall in love with a girl whom one has met only three times. A
moment's reflection enabled him to diagnose his sensations correctly. The odd
impulse to leap across the compartment and kiss her was not love. It was merely
the natural desire of a good hearted young man to be decently chummy with his
species."
</p>

<p>
"Rupert Baxter, the Earl of Emsworth's indefatigable Private Secretary, was one
of those men whose chief characteristic is a vague suspicion of their fellow
human beings. He did not suspect them of this or that definite crime: he simply
suspected them."
</p>

<p>
Alright, that hopefully is the impetus you were craving. Remember, you can
only spoil a Wodehouse story by not reading it.
</p>

<p>
Happy reading time!
</p>

<p>
Cheers.
