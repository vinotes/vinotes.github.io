"On the morning of July 14, 1789, a crowd of Parisian workers set out to attack
the royal prison of the Bastille. Joined by deserting soldiers who brought
cannons, and ignored by Royal Army troops camped nearby, the crowds forced their
way into the fortress by late afternoon, killing the governor and parading his
head on a pike. That evening King Louis XVI reportedly asked a duke, "is this a
revolt?" To which the duke replied: "No Sire, it is a revolution"" – excerpt
from J. A. Goldstone's book, Revolutions, A Very Short Introduction.
</p>

<p>
In the second episode of this series, we continue to blend into our topic of
Political Ideologies through French Revolution. Hope is to present a succinct
summary of the events, and then proceed to ask the mammoth question, 'Why?'
Welcome to Hitchens' Razor!
</p>

<p>
Someone had noticed that it is hard to talk about the French Revolution, not for
the lack of resources, because there is a plethora of it. So, before we begin
the revolution, may I regurgitate our gratefulness to the following authors for
their great work on the topic, which has immensely helped us to tell the tale.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Georges Lefebvre, The French Revolution, translated to English by Elizabeth Moss Evanson</li>
<li>William Doyle, The French Revolution, a VSI</li>
<li>Jack Goldstone, Revolutions VSI</li>
</ol>
<p>
and a shout out to Jawaharlal Nehru for 'The Glimpses of World History', and
H.G.Wells as well for 'A Short History of the World'.
</p>

<p>
Although the narrative is simplified to be retold as a lucid story, there are
many places where we have directly quoted from some of the above authors without
saying so. We hope to leech on your ample-supple magnanimity to forgive us.
</p>

<p>
Shall we?

<div id="outline-container-org0e788d9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0e788d9">The Story</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0e788d9">
<p>
Our story begins in 18th century of the Common Era.
</p>

<p>
France's attempt to remain a global super force meant waging war with other
kingdoms. They fought all over the world, at both land and the sea, in America,
in Asia, and in native Europe. Engaging in relentless war means destruction;
destruction calls for rebuilding; rebuilding costs money. During hard times,
money demands either financial discipline or bankruptcy. For France, it was the
latter. They were running out of money. 
</p>

<p>
How did the French fund these wars in the first place? Well, the Finance
minister borrowed money from Freemason banks and wealthy individual financiers
of Europe. Wait, was there a system of government? Yes! It is what we now call
the <i>ancien regime</i>. Under <i>ancien regime</i> the French society was then
classified into three orders: The nobles(wealthy and powerful), The clergy(God
people), and the Third Estate, i.e. everyone else. &lt;beat&gt; Geographically, France
was divided into provinces, and there were courts or <i>parlements</i> for each
province. The parlements were judicial bodies with around 1100 judges
nationwide. The members of the parlements were aristocrats or nobles who had
bought or inherited their offices, and were independent of the king. They
wielded decision making powers on a wide range of subjects. Apart from this, the
king had his ministers to take care of the kingdom's affairs. Okay, back to
funding wars. For France, supporting the American war of Independence to defeat
the British was dear. They had availed loans to enable the military, and
borrowed even more money to pay off the arrears. &lt;beat&gt; Such was the deficit in
August 1786, the Finance minister sent a letter to the king mentioning the need
for a state reform. It was first of its kind act for France. Things turned worse
in the following year; so much that in March 1788 the first budget of the old
regime was needed to be drafted. Oddly enough, this was also the last budget of
the old regime. It estimated a 20% deficit at 126 million livres. More than half
of the expenditures were attributed to paying debts alone. &lt;beat&gt; The taxes in
the country was already high, so raising taxes further to clear the arrears was
out of the question. There existed a solution to the problem though, that is to
bring equality of taxation for different classes of people and provinces of the
country. &lt;beat&gt; And that's how it all began!
</p>

<p>
Shall we move on from the state of economics to the state of people? French
revolution could be broadly divided into three stages. The Aristocratic
revolution, the Bourgeoisie revolution, and the Popular revolution. We shall
begin with the Aristocracy's quarrel, that is the Nobles' and Clergy's quarrel
with their king.
</p>

<p>
At the verge of bankruptcy, the finance minister proposed new measures to raise
funds. This included:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A direct land tax upon all landowners without any exception</li>
<li>Other taxes to be shared out without distinction as to order or class</li>
<li>Freeing the grain trade from all controls, by abolishing internal customs barriers</li>
<li>Asking clergy to clear its debt by selling the Church's manorial rights</li>
</ol>
<p>
The good minister thought that financial stability would strengthen his king's
royal power, and reduce the opposition from parlements. The King Louis VI was a
weak monarch; &lt;beat&gt; he had very little power and control over the country's
affairs. He was considered almost a laughing stock of his courtiers and all
those who had heard the stories. Aware of this status, the finance minister used
indirect methods to get the tax reforms done. He convoked a meeting with the
representatives of aristocrats and the clergy, also known as the Assembly of
Notables to discuss the reforms. He expected the Notables to agree to the
changes because of the economic condition of their kingdom. But this move
backfired, as it amplified the frailties of the king, and it angered the
Notables even more, as they thought it was an attack on their powers and
rights. They rejected the proposal and after some internal politics the finance
minster was dismissed. The replacement minister soothed the aristocracy by
retracting the proposal, and instead offered to increase the stamp duty. But the
Notables and the parlements rejected the new tax proposal as well, because this
decision was not in their power, but was to be made by the wider group called
Estates-General or the States-General representatives of France.
</p>

<p>
The debt remained, and the new finance minister was now desperate to raise
money. Uncertain of the support from the parlements and aristocracy, he had the
King pass an edict as a royal order superseding any opposition. Nevertheless,
opposition duly came from a duke, and the duke was exiled by the King in
retaliation.  The parlements and lower tribunals and the aristocrats promptly
protested, which turned violent at places. Tit for tat continued as the King
started showing hints of despotism. The treasury was almost empty at this point
amidst the mayhem, and the King finally gave away and dismissed the Finance
minister again. The consensus pointed to the convocation of Estates-General for
any tax related decision making. Like before, that is in 1614, the convocation
was to have three orders representing the classification of the French society;
The clergy, The nobles, and the Third Estate.
</p>

<p>
What you have heard until now is the revolution that happened in the
background. The Aristocratic Revolution! The Nobles and Clergy against the
monarch. The second part, which you are about to hear is called the Bourgeoisie
Revolution.
</p>

<p>
The Third Estate, that is everyone else also contained the bourgeoisie. We have
spoken a great deal about the rise of the middle class, i.e. the bourgeoisie in
the previous episode. The news of gathering of the Estates-General sent tremors
of excitement through the members of the Third Estate. Until then, they have had
not seen much need for opposing the two classes above them. Suddenly the mood
shifted. Many associations sprung up in this time - academies, agricultural
societies, philanthropic groups, reading circles. They sought equality in the
society thorough arguments of reason and natural right. Equality of taxation,
and voting by heads rather than order was their major demands. Of course, the
burden of the proposed new taxes fell disproportionately on the shoulders of
third estate, when compared to the clergy and the nobles. Meanwhile the Nobles
and the Clergy assured of their birth and divine rights, demanded a vote at the
this meeting. Since Estates-General voted by order than by head, any two estates
could outvote a third. This arrangement naturally favoured the upper
classes. &lt;beat&gt; The mood of aristocracy during the French revolution is captured
in this extract of a letter sent to the king by the royal princes.
</p>

<p>
Estates-General. France was all set for the rendezvous. A hotel was arranged for
the meetings of the clergy and the nobility. A big national hall was arranged
for the third estate to meet. All party meetings were to be held in a large room
nearby. The nobles and clergy dressed in full regalia were seated on elevated
platforms, whereas the third estate representatives dressed in black were seated
on chairs at the floor level. On 5th May 1789, the proceedings began with a
brief speech by the king. Then the finance minister harangued the audience,
speaking at length about the financial situation with all sorts of boring
details. He mentioned the proposed improvements of the situation, but omitted
the subject of constitutional reforms, which everyone was desperate to hear. But
he mentioned the voting would happen by order as before. There were serious
opposition to this, but at that time the representatives didn't know each other
well, so they proceeded with caution, and a delaying tactic was used. Stalemate
continued where each order discussed further action in their allocated
places. At the beginning, the Third Estate had taken a new name for itself;
communes or, Commons. Not many knew that word evoked a vague memory of popular
resistance to the feudal lords. For the Commons, they simply refused to be
relegated to the third rank.
</p>

<p>
Few days later, the nobility, strong on its belief, announced themselves as a
separate order. The Clergy meanwhile was in trouble because a large proportion
of the parish church or the district church priests, supported the Commons. The
bishops sensed imminent defection of the parish priests. So they requested the
king to intervene. The King asked the conferences to be resumed at the common
place, in the presence of his ministers. The finance minister further said that
if no agreement could be reached, then the king's decision would be final. This
put the Commons in a difficult position, but ironically the nobility rejected
that royal arbitration proposal.
</p>

<p>
The Commons now invited privileged members to join them. Many parish priests
did, but not one noble. With the new members the Third Estate's name was again
changed to National Assembly. They demanded that all three classes be merged and
voting shall be done by heads instead of order. They further claimed the power
to consent to taxation. The nobility now ended their resistance towards the king
and begged him to put the Third Estate back in line. But by now the majority of
the clergy declared in favour of merging the three orders. Finally the finance
minister came out and proposed equality of taxation and voting by heads. The
King still hesitated. One fine day, the National Assembly, formerly known as the
Commons, formerly known as the Third Estate discovered that the national hall
where they met regularly to discuss their affairs was closed without any notice
or warning. Certainly not defeated yet, they immediately convened in a Tennis
court nearby, and took an oath to give France a constitution.
</p>

<p>
The king now disregarding his Finance minister, came up with his own
declarations guaranteeing a constitutional system, civil liberty etc, but
equality of taxation and voting by head was omitted. He then dismissed the
assembly, but the members of National Assembly did not move. They said: "We will
not stir from our seats unless forced by bayonets." Following this, many nobles
also joined the commons, and the king eventually gave away and asked others to
follow the suit. The legal, peaceful revolution of the bourgeoisie appeared
victorious at this point. The nobles considered this as a humiliation, albeit
not accepting defeat. The king on the other hand saw the members of National
Assembly as rebels. First step, they had to get rid of the Finance minister who
had supported the National Assembly's cause. He was dismissed arbitrarily and
exiled. The bourgeoisie revolution seemed lost, but they were saved &lt;beat&gt; by
the people, the proletarians, the peasants. That is the third part of the French
Revolution, the Popular revolution!
</p>

<p>
We hope to talk more about the economic crisis and its effect in a later
episode.
</p>

<p>
For the lower classes, the peasants and artisans the crisis plus the recent crop
failure meant hunger and poverty. The hammer-crush burden of the nation's taxes
fell on their thin shoulders. Bread was their staple, and it's prices kept
increasing steadily. The old Finance minister had ordered large purchases from
abroad, and labour camps were setup for distributing food. People, especially in
the countryside were driven into desperation by the active tax collectors. The
masses had to pay taxes, both direct and indirect, and thus pay for their own
oppression. In all these the nobles and monarchy enjoyed their pomp and
luxury. The hungry peasants of France were asked to eat grass by a
governor. There were millions of professional beggars in France then. But the
news of Estates-General kindled hope, a vision of future in them, especially
since it had only happened two centuries ago. They thought, since the king
consulted his people, he pitied their plight, writes Lefebvre. The great hope
also inflamed fearful passions. The Third Estate was convinced that the nobles
would stubbornly defend their privileges. The villagers thought the nobles would
crush them using any measures. Foreign powers would be called to help put down
the villagers. Meanwhile, in the background the dismissal of the good finance
minister was seen as an act of aristocratic conspiracy. So they thought they
should fight, taking up arms, releasing prisoners and recruiting them, forming
their own army against the nobles. The king and the courts thought they should
react to this social hullaballoo to keep things under control. Suddenly the
capital city was filled with 20000 soldiers, much of them were foreign mercenary
troops. That's that!  When a German troop tried to disperse crowd in Paris, the
hungry citizens decided to act, and French guards and military decided to help
the people. They started ransacking the strong points in the city for Guns and
food. Storming into a prison, releasing its inmates, and brutally killing the
guard commander who had earlier ordered to fire on them, the taking of Bastille
was complete. The fall of Bastille.
</p>

<p>
This quote from William Doyle's French Revolution sums up the episode, "The
National Assembly had seized sovereign power in the name of the France
Nation. It was the founding act of the French Revolution. If the Nation was
sovereign, the king no longer was."
</p>

<p>
The National Assembly was indirectly helped by the proletarians and the
peasants, and other hungry people of France. One thing to remember is that none
of these happened overnight. For instance, the convocation of the Estates
General was in fact proclaimed in mid 1788, whereas the revolution officially
kicked off a year later in 1789. The economic and political crisis is said to
have begun at least an year earlier before the proclamation of Estates-General
in 1787. It's funny, that Bastille prison only had 7 inmates when it was
stormed.  It rather shows the fall of a symbol of royal power and pride, and the
release of new ideas. The politics of social antagonism which started in Paris
have had now spread to the countryside. The whole feeling later was transcended
into paranoia of loss. We shall stop our narration of the French revolution
here. As they say, the rest is history! That in summary includes:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Abolition of privileges</li>
<li>October Days, when a group of women marched to Versailles to escort the King
to Paris, the epicentre of revolution.</li>
<li>Church property nationalised</li>
<li>Nobility abolished</li>
<li>Parliament abolished</li>
<li>Civil constitution for Church, i.e. a common platform for Catholics and Protestants</li>
<li>War with neighbours</li>
<li>Liberty Fraternity Equality</li>
<li>Monarch executed in 1793</li>
<li>Massacres</li>
<li>Napoleon</li>
</ol>

and much, much more if you wish to zoom in, enough content for another series.
But now we must stop and try to identify links to Political Ideologies.
