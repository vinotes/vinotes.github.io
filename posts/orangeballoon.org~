The night, soothingly quiet, our poet awoke in her bed.
Eyes wide, a story unsaid, raging in her head.
She leapt to her desk and started scribbling away,
With hope that the memory of her dream would stay.

Lying on a hammock she thought,
About a piquant dream she caught. 
An unsaid story that she must tell,
But out of her mind it suddenly fell.

There was the familiar little girl,
Who wore a necklace made of pearl.
Ah..! that curious world inside a crystal bowl,
And indeed the villain who looked like her brother Paul.

Enter villain with an orange balloon in his hand,
Three feet tall, skinny lad was all tanned.
With him he always brought his own music band,
Popular songs they played were all banned.

The orange balloon hovered over his head like a halo,
Her eyes twinkled as she went to say hello.
Will you give me that orange balloon I crave?
Quid pro quo, young lady, what will you give?
Shake hands with me for it little doll?
No, you always squeeze my fingers like a troll.
Sing a song about Tweedledum but not Tweedledee?
Its impossible! How dare you demand such a deed?
The pearl necklace then, yes?
Oh, no, villains can't have necklaces.

I know, villains always lose in the end.
Right you are! here, take it my friend.
As she reached out for the balloon, he let it fly,
Ha-ha! where's the fun in not letting it touch the sky.

She woke up with a start, still lying on her hammock,
The pearl necklace was planted safely on her neck.
Opened her book and started scribbling away,
With hope that the memory of her dream would stay.

The night, soothingly quiet, is coming to its end,
The poet now stood in her balcony facing the cold wind.
Words rhyming on her book, Pearls shining on her neck,
As she smiled at an orange balloon that dawned up in the sky.
