*/What happened?/*

I was reading a book and suddenly heard a loud noise from outside.

*/Can you please elaborate?/*

That's what sir, BANG!, and seconds later, a second BANG.

*/Will you be able to recreate your evening till the incident?/*

Yes, sir. Yesterday I came back late from work to attend two more late evening
meetings. Ms. Elusive Luck's birthday, both meetings got cancelled at my
arrival. So, I practised music for what I thought was an hour.  Sir, It was a
good workout, and by the end I was sweating and shivering from forehead to
heels. I wrapped the set, and was hungrily wandering indoors.  That's when i saw
the most beautiful thing on my study table. A banana!  Who keeps a banana on a
study table, sir? Well, I did. Yesterday morning.  Sync sir, Unbelievable.

*/Alright, then what?/*

Sir, I thought of cooking dinner. Dosa in my mind, I found couple of duck eggs
in the fridge. 'Egg Dosa' creeped, sorry, crept into my head. I fetched Dosa
batter and eggs to the warmth outside. Roasted some curry leaves, and ground
them with chillies into a lush green paste. Fried some Coin Pappads as well.

An eerie silence lurked in the kitchen while I was chopping onions. I added salt
and a pinch of turmeric to the onions. Then I introduced our dear eggs to Madame
la Guillotine, CRACK! its viscous yellow head crashed into the bowl.  I stirred
a motley mixture with all that. When the pan on the stove started whispering to
the winds I threw a water blanket over it. The pan hissed and shot
sodium-in-water tantrums at me. I calmly slid the hot bubbling bubbles into the
sink. Then I painted a solar system on the pan with batter.  The system had to
be perfect. A subtle press in the center followed by concentric Sufi
whirling. It must spread into a round Gaussian distribution and scatter a
Brownian motion of batter pores. The pores would channel the steam upwards,
cooking the layers above en route its itinerary. Then, I sprayed oil, and
smeared the lush green paste on top of the maturing Dosa.  Few seconds later, I
massaged the duck egg mash on the green pasture.  Juxtaposition, hitherto
unrealistic, was accomplished.

Sir, I flipped the Dosa, and waited for the other side to get cooked, flipped it
again, and kept the Dosa aside. Made one more Dosa like that, sir. Later, I ate
both Dosas with Maple syrup, Chammanthi Podi, and Coin pappads sir.  
Sync sir, Unbelievable.

*/What is a Chammanthi podi?/* \\
Sir, this is not the appropriate time sir. Maybe later.

*/Then?/*

I had a pear, drank 350ml of water, brushed my teeth, wrote a blog post, washed
my legs, and went to bed. I continued reading the book "To kill a mockingbird",
when suddenly heard a loud noise from outside sir.

*/Is that it?/*\\
Yes sir.

/Well, write down your address and phone number. You will have to come to the/
/police station when called upon, to give your statement about yesterday's/
/incident./

Done deal sir. Many peace.
