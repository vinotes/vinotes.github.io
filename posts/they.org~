At the core of it, living in a society demands interactions with fellow human
beings. If we were to live in caves, as we used to, then pronouns wouldn't have
mattered much. But now, as a collective, we are past that stage of
civilisation. Of course there is always a war, lack of basic amenities to a
large proportion of population, novel diseases, climate change, and other
crisis, etc., but those are macro-issues. Language on the other hand is
day-to-day, it impact our interactions with our real friends, social media
friends, colleagues, colleagues, and every other person you meet. It is the
fabric of a society. It has continuously evolved, and has been improved,
criticised, adapted over the centuries, and will continue to do so.
