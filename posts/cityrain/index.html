                <p>
Like an ancient civilization, the city slept,<br>
In an endless commute, its way of life wept.<br>
In mirky buildings and sulky streets,<br>
Boredom grumbled and happiness crumbled.<br>
Hither and yon people ran to make ends meet,<br>
And that's when the first drop of rain came to greet.<br></p>

<hr>
<p>
His highness's arrival was announced by Dhol drums,<br>
Boisterous, it lifted the city out of its doldrums.<br>
Bewitched the wind into a wicked poltergeist,<br>
Which possessed the poor trees at first sight.<br>
Made them dance with no rhyme, nor reason,<br>
The city was under its spell in a summer season.<br></p>

<hr>
<p>
At the first drop, across the tar road, he boarded a bus, red,<br>
Sitting by a window, he peered outside - pandemonium manifested.<br>
Citizens with books, and bags, and sarees over their head,<br>
Steam rising, from a packed tea shop in the distance, ahead,<br>
A woman wrestling with nature to ignite a cigarette,<br>
He shared a laugh with nature at this singular etiquette.<br>
An umbrella afloat, weightless in a whirlwind,<br>
A fine mocking at humankind failing to take a hint.<br>
The rain gained momentum as the bus coughed forward,<br>
He looked behind and saw memories travelling backwards.<br>
As he closed his eyes, a downpour of nostalgia deluged his face,<br>
A boy buoyant in his village pond, droplets of euphoria in his gaze.<br></p>

<hr>
<p>
At the first drop, she picked up the book, her precious company,<br>
The wooden arm chair beckoned her from the spacious balcony.<br>
Feet up on the chair, rocking back and forth,<br>
She witnessed sky coalesce with the earth.<br>
A deep breath flooded her heart with petrichor,<br>
An open book capsized her brain vessels in bibliochor.<br>
For once, her heart and brain agreed,<br>
Knowledge is the purpose of her life ahead.<br></p>

<hr>
<p>
At the first drop, they said, let's keep playing,<br>
This can't get any better, keep the ball rolling.<br>
The rain couldn't drench their jerseys wet,<br>
For they were already saturated in sweat.<br>
Raindrops across flood lights, quite a sight,<br>
A special game, they must win this with all their might.<br>
A hot shower awaits, a Biryani, and perhaps a drive into the night,<br>
When the city shines bright, and it grows young until the first light.<br></p>

<hr>
<p>
At the first drop, he sought her presence,<br>
She was not found inside their residence.<br>
He stared at the flight of stairs,<br>
A hop, skip, and a jump to the terrace.<br>
There she stood staring at the sky,<br>
Palms open, her hands lifted shoulder high.<br>
She wore pink clothes soaked from head-to-toe,<br>
He moved closer and hugged her apropos.<br>
She stepped on his feet as he kissed on top of her head,<br>
Shaking hands wrapped around his chest, thus her face rested.<br>
In that chilling juxtaposition they stood in silence,<br>
Under the rain, pure love melded into a timeless ambience.<br></p>

<hr>
<p>
At the first drop, poet slid into the kitchen,<br>
A cup of tea with a hint of mint and lemon.<br>
The curtains swung over the library irking the shadows,<br>
A venerable fountain pen lay on the table in its repose.<br>
The pen kissed the paper, then and back again,<br>
Until poet read the words, "City Rain".<br></p>
