                <p>
Like an ancient civilization, the city slept,<br>
In an endless commute, this way of life wept.<br>
In its mirky buildings and sulky streets,<br>
Boredom grumbled, and happiness crumbled.<br>
Hither and yon, people ran, to make ends meet,<br>
And that's when, the first drop of rain, came to greet.<br></p>


<p>
His highness's arrival was announced by Dhol drums,<br>
Boisterously, it lifted the city out of its doldrums.<br>
Bewitched the wind, into a wicked poltergeist,<br>
Possesed the trees, like an unseen ghost,<br>
Made them dance with no rhyme, nor reason,<br>
The city was put under its spell, in a dry summer season.<br>
Windows were shattered; Wind owes nothing in the end.<br>
Clothes were brandished; One shall never pretend.<br></p>


<p>
At the first drop, across the tar road, he boarded a bus, red,<br>
Sitting by a window, he peered outside - pandemonium appeared.<br>
Citizens with books, and bags, and sarees above their head,<br>
Steam rising, from a packed tea shop in the distance, up ahead,<br>
A woman wrestling with wind, to ignite a cigarrete,<br>
Strolling while nature is mopping; a singular etiquette.<br>
A buoyant umbrella was floating in a whirlwind,<br>
Nature mocking the anticipation of humankind.<br>
The rain gained momentum as the bus coughed forward,<br>
He looked behind and saw memories travelleing backward.<br>
Closed his eyes, the downpour deluged his face with euphoria,<br>
A song surfaced from his childhood that rhymed with liquid nostalgia.<br></p>


<p>
At the first drop, she picked up the book, her precious company,<br>
The wooden arm chair, beckoned her from the spacious balcony;<br>
Feet up on the chair, rocking back and forth,<br>
She witnessed the sky coalesce with earth.<br>
Closed her eyes; her breath flooded heart with petrichor,<br>
Opened the book; her brain vessels capsized in bibliochor.<br>
For once, her heart and brain agreed to this moment,<br>
Purpose of life is knowlegde; it makes you content.<br></p>


<p>
At the first drop, they said, let's keep playing,<br>
This can't get any better, keep the ball rolling.<br>
The rain couldn't drench their jerseys wet,<br>
For they were already saturated in sweat.<br>
Raindrops crossing flood lights was quite a sight,<br>
Win this special game, they must, with all their might.<br>
Awaits, a hot water bath, a biryani, and perhaps a drive into the night,<br>
When the city shines bright, the night grows young until the first light.<br></p>


<p>
At the first drop, he sought her presence,<br>
She was not found in their residence.<br>
He looked at the flight of stairs,<br>
Spun on his feet, and went to the terrace.<br>
There she stood staring at the sky,<br>
Palms open, her hands were lifted shoulder high.<br>
Her pink clothes soaked from head-to-toe,<br>
He moved closer and hugged her apropos.<br>
She stepped on his feet; He kissed on top of her head,<br>
Her hands wrapped around his chest, where her face rested.<br>
In that chilling juxtaposition, they stood in silence,<br>
Under the rain, they melded into the timeless ambience.<br></p>


<p>
At the first drop, Poet moved to the kitchen,<br>
For a cup of tea with a hint of mint and lemon.<br>
The curtains swung over the room irking the shadows,<br>
A venerable fountain pen lay on the table in its repose.<br>
The pen kissed the paper, then and back again,<br>
Until Poet read the words, "City Rain".<br></p>
