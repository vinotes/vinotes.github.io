Midnight, Manchester.

An otherwise remarkably quiet residential area was woken up by blaring sirens of
what was unmistakably police cars. Peeped through the window to witness a
chase. Unidentified grey car speedily approaching a junction; followed by three
police cars with dancing lights and high-pitched sirens. Grey car trying to
escape into a narrow alleyway only to be stopped by barricades. That path was
clearly reserved for pedestrians supporting climate change. Grey car rammed into
one of the barricades, and that was enough for the police cars to corner it. The
Hero/Villain(just a matter of perspective isn't it?) abandoned the car and ran
for it. Officers followed him. Sirens and dancing light remained in the
junction.

Seven minutes later...

Villain/Hero was now handcuffed and being pushed back towards the junction. The
police searched him to find nothing on him. Searched the grey car and the
officer's hand was reassuringly empty. Another officer asked the Villain/Hero,
"The car is stolen innit?". Officer walked towards the license plate and pulled
it to find another license plate underneath it. "Fornicating hell, you're right",
shouted somebody. The Villain/Thief was arrested and carried away in his
silence. Sirens went off, lights out, grey car was towed away. Remarkably quiet
residential area went back to sleep. I need to get some sleep as well. Tickets
for the new James Bond movie is already booked for tomorrow night show. Well, I
will watch it anyway.

Many Peace.
