"Man was born" free, and he is everywhere in chains", Rousseau, wrote in his book, 'The social contract'
</p>

<p>
We stopped our previous episode with a promise to find links between the French
Revolution and Political Ideologies. That's exactly what we are craving
today. To answer the gargantuan three letter question, 'Why'? To see if there
had been a change in western thought prior to the French revolution.
</p>

<p>
Welcome to Hitchens' Razor!
</p>

<p>
In the first episode of this series, we performed a somersault recap of world
history to arrive at the main event - the social big bang as I like to call it;
the French Revolution of the 18th century CE.  In the second episode, we tried
to deconstruct the story of the revolution. In both these episodes, we journeyed
through the Feudal system, where power was based on the ownership of the land;
to the ancien regime, where power was inherited or god-given, and finally the
power of the constitution. The society was then classified into Nobles, Clergy
and Everyone else. All three orders were subjected to a monarch, who had the
divine right to rule. Then suddenly the status quo vanished, the heads of
monarchy and royalty started rolling on the floor. Well, 'suddenly' is a word
best used in hindsight. In reality, it was not all that sudden, was it?  It
takes many years to brew revolutions.
</p>

<p>
Before we dive in to the topic, I would like cite our thanks:

</ol>
<p>
So, what causes revolutions? In other words, what fails to keep societies stable
and resilient? &lt;beat&gt; In a stable society, the economic cycle turns smoothly,
people produce, earn, pay taxes, and still have sufficient income left to
support themselves and their families. The taxes paid by the populace reach the
ruler, who distributes it for various purposes. One of them being the protection
of its people. This equilibrium is maintained by the institutions of the land -
the bureaucracy, military, religion etc. What causes in-equilibrium then?
</p>

<p>
Poverty is the simplest explanation, but in truth that alone isn't the
reason. It is rather curious an observation that revolutions occur more often in
middle-income countries than in the very poorest nations. French revolution
happened when the peasants in France were better off than peasants in
Russia. Also, like we mentioned in the previous episode, the French Revolution
had three parts to it: the aristocratic, the bourgeoisie, and the popular
revolutions. It seems that revolutions happen when significant portions of the
elites, and the military defect or stand aside instead of defending the old
regime. Apart from this, here are some reasons according to Goldstone:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Demographic changes</li>
<li>International relations</li>
<li>Flatlining of economy</li>
<li>Inequality, discrimination</li>
<li>Personalist regimes</li>
</ol>
<p>
So why did the Kingdom of France fail? That is a bait we wouldn't dare to take
today. Instead we would try to generalise the causes of revolutions, not just in
France, but other countries of the west as well. Though the consensus is rather
stable at the inexplicable nature of the causation of revolutions, there was a
point in one of our previous episodes where I tried to empathise with the common
people of Europe in the middle ages. I invite you to join me in thinking… &lt;beat&gt;
</p>

<p>
"Think about a generation which had witnessed their mothers, sisters and grand
mothers burnt at stake; their brothers and fathers hanged, drawn and
quartered. A generation that was forced into becoming professional beggars. And
the only explanation available for all these misery was religion; of their
present sufferings being rewarded in another world, in another life. But aren't
we pattern seeking animals? and when we identify patterns don't we have the
tendency to act on it?  &lt;beat&gt; I think it was inevitable, the rulers of the
western world was begging for a change, for a revolution."
</p>

<p>
That's our empathy, but the bigger question is, 'Did the western thought change
at some point'? &lt;beat&gt; How?
</p>
<div id="outline-container-orgf7bfbd6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf7bfbd6">Land</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf7bfbd6">
<p>
Perhaps we could use the classification of society in the middle ages to explain
the transition in thought process at each level. We start with land. Lefebvre
writes, "Land was virtually the only source of income in an aristocratic world
where priests and nobles were royal subjects. The state had all the sovereign
powers. The Lords had authority over their own peasants. Serfdom existed in
regions of western Europe. Its subjects were bound to the land, which was
strictly limited to rights of inheritance. The economy was stagnant. Production
was limited by scarcity, rules, and war. People sough assistance and protection
of family and communities, and parish. Competition in the market was restricted
with controls.  Extra work or pro-activeness fetched no reward because the
system shackled it.  Advertisements were useless, people waited for clients to
approach them, and so they sold very little for high prices. Taxes, hierarchy,
and authority remained in the society. Along with this the lower classes
continued to hold superstitious beliefs in magic, sorcery, astrology, and
alchemy."
</p>

<p>
The bourgeoisie didn't see much hope in this static society. So, they ventured
beyond their land.

<p>
After the barbarian conquests, Europeans forayed into invasion mode. They
travelled far and wide to different continents and brought back all kinds of
treasures. The contagious example of material success encouraged all those who
judged themselves capable of enjoying rewards offered during this life
itself. They returned home rich. Money bought them privileges, and eventually
power, and changes followed.

<h2 id="org737b7e9">Scientific Revolution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org737b7e9">
<p>
When science arrived at the scene, the hitherto magical explanation of the
universe started to wane, for science's intention was to condense the whole
universe to a series of equations, and scientists were becoming increasingly
successful at this.
</p>

<p>
"One of the important innovations in this era" writes Lefebvre, "was the ability
to fix positions geographically, which was essential for navigation as well as
to the measurement of globe and cartography(that is the art of making maps or
charts). New nautical instruments such as the compass, the sextant were
invented, and Borda's circle determined latitudes. Construction of the
chronometer and maritime clocks and basic establishment of astronomical charts
meant that longitudes could be calculated rather than simply estimated. These
were revolutionary advances."  Science enabled the discovery and control of
natural forces.
</p>

<p>
The scientific worldview drastically changed when the Polish astronomer Nicolas
Copernicus claimed that is sun is the centre of the universe, not
earth. Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei carried the baton forward. Kepler
accepted the Copernican view and improved it by claiming the planetary bodies
revolved in ellipses than in circles. He also calculated the speed of this
motion. Galileo pointed his telescope at heavens and found interesting
phenomena. He also argued against the Aristotelian theory that heavier objects
falls faster than lighter ones, saying all bodies will fall towards earth at the
same rate if not for the air resistance they feel. He used the language of
Mathematics to explain physical things. He also emphasised testing out
hypothesis experimentally. The scientific revolution continued with Rene
Descartes's in the 17th century with his mechanical philosophy where he
explained the physical world in terms of particles interacting and colliding
with one another. After Descartes, Issac Newton published the Mathematical
Principles of Natural Philosophy in the late 17th century which improved
Cartesian theory with great accuracy. His three laws seemed to explain all
observable phenomena in the world. He also invented the mathematical technique
called Calculus to explain the theory. He was able to prove Kepler's laws of
planetary motion, and Galileo's law of free fall using his theory. Differential
and integral Calculus was developed by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in parallel to
Newton.

<h2 id="org6992437">Age of Enlightenment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6992437">
<p>
We cannot escape the topic of philosophy when we are trying to answer the
question, 'Why'.  With Philosophy comes its philosophers, and we are going to
have a tryst with some of the philosophers of the age of enlightenment, and
dance our way through the major thoughts and ideas of the age. But first, let's
address the elephant in the room, God. Omnipotent is the claim, and omnipresent
is this mammoth in the history books of philosophy. Pray, we shall dare to seek
an explanation of the societal transformation by starting God on the bench. It
is thus, with utmost convenience, that we discard the divine intervention in our
search for the answer. You see, most of our philosophers were believers and
theologians, but please remember that they arrived and departed before Charles
Darwin. Fair play to them, there has had been a Galapagos sized gap in their
head that had to be filled, which they did, with god, with questions about body
and mind, liberty, equality, justice, morality, ethics, social contract, natural
rights, happiness, scientific rationalism, physics, metaphysics, economic
prosperity, free markets and so on and so forth.
</p>

<p>
We had a brief brushing with physics in the previous section, and now, to
metaphysics. It seems <i>meta</i> in ancient Greek meant ‘after’. So ‘metaphysics’,
yes…, after physics. Physics is about things that change; the metaphysics is
about things that don’t change. So, natural science investigates things in this
world or universe which tend to change or move or transform, which can be
sensed, observed, experimented upon, or experienced, whereas, metaphysics
transcends experience. It concerns mind where physics is concerned with
body. And that is philosophy.
</p>

<p>
The two dominant branches of western philosophy during the age of enlightenment
are called the Empiricism and Rationalism. Interestingly, there is an
intersection of these two schools of thought and further advancement of western
philosophy from that point. Empiricism comes from <i>empeiria</i> meaning
"experience; mere experience or practice without knowledge. Rationalism, on the
other hand comes from <i>reason</i>. Either way, the two questions that really
matters in political philosophy are: 'Who gets what', and 'says who'? The first
is about the distribution of goods, and of rights and liberties. The second
question concerns the distribution of Political power. One task for the
political philosopher is to determine the correct balance between autonomy and
authority.
</p>

<p>
Of the two major factions or western philosophy, Empiricism began with Francis
Bacon(1561-1626). <i>'Knowledge is power'</i>, is his famous dictum. He emphasised on
the need for seeking evidence to prove things. A methodical approach to the
investigation of the nature and limits of human mind and then to draw
consequences for how we should regulate our beliefs and actions. Empiricists
believed that an idea in the mind that can be traced back to some particular
experience. Ideas come from senses or sense-impressions of the past.
</p>

<p>
Rene Descartes(1596-1650), is believed to be the originator of rationalism. <i>'I
think, therefore I am'</i>, is his famous dictum. Rationalists believed that ideas
are innate, it came from within. They used deductive reasoning to explain things
using axioms as the premise, and deduction as the method to derive conclusions.
</p>

<p>
Before we go any further, a friendly reminder on why people had to think about
these things. We have already touched upon the way of life in the ancien regime,
of religious dogmas, of superstitious beliefs in magic, sorcery, astrology, and
alchemy. The intellectual exercises of the age of enlightenment were not merely
a departure from the status quo, but a discontinuity in the way of life
itself. There was a break in the continuity of thoughts and debates from the
medieval ages. Ernst Cassirer has some interesting observations in his book <i>'The
myth of the state'</i> where he says "All the progress made by the Renaissance and
the Reformation were counterbalanced by the loss of unity and inner harmony of
the medieval culture, especially ethical foundation of the medieval civilization
was seriously affected. The heliocentric system deprived man of his privileged
condition. He became, as it were, an exile in the infinite universe. The cracks
formed in Christianity were irreparable. Only Reason, which is autonomous and
self-dependent could bring back the ethics and harmony."
</p>

<p>
Cassirer also writes that political theories of the age of enlightenment was a
rejuvenation of Stoic ideas. Stoicism is from the Greek and Roman period which
is capsuled in the phrase <i>'Virtue is its own reward'</i>. Morality and happiness is
derived from following virtues like wisdom, courage, controlling emotions,
justice, and living in accordance with nature. All these political theories have
a common metaphysical background than a theological one. This is backed by
mathematics and reasoning.
</p>

<p>
In a way, writes Milan Zafirovski in his book <i>The Enlightenment and Its Effects
on Modern Society</i>, "the Enlightenment operates as the composite process of
intellectual destruction and deconstruction of the values and institutions of
the ancien regime as a total social system and of creation or projection of
those of a new society. The inner logic, essential process, and ultimate outcome
of the Enlightenment are the destruction of old oppressive, theocratic,
irrational, and inhumane social values and institutions, and the creation of
new democratic, secular, rational, and humane ones through human reason or, as
Immanuel Kant put it, “dare to think.”
</p>

<p>
The famous words from American Declaration of Independence: "All men are created
equal with certain unalienable rights to life, liberty and pursuit of
happiness". To secure these rights, governments are instituted among men,
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed", are the effects of
these ideas. That was the noticeable change; Ideas started to have
consequences. Revolutions are the prime examples of that. I think with the
formation of parliaments, and republics in Europe and North America, and the
social revolution of France, we witnessed a reciprocity of thoughts and actions.
Most of these ideas were repeated from the past, but now these ideas were forged
into weapons. The attack became direct. Their is no veiled disguise or use of
abstract terms anymore. Straight to the point. Ecrasez l'infâme, said Voltaire,
"Crush the loathsome thing", and he was referring to the Roman Catholic Church.
</p>

<p>
With that we move on to Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau. Thomas Hobbes(1588-1679) is
most famous for his book Leviathan, in which he invites the reader to travel to
a hypothetical world where there is no civilisation or societies. It is called
the state of nature. In the state of nature there are no rules, or morals, or
ethics attached to the people. The question is then to ask how and why did that
change? It is a thought experiment similar to parents reprimanding children for
wasting food by saying, 'you will understand the value of it in its absence'.
</p>

<p>
Hobbes was rather pessimistic about life of human in the state of nature. He was
inspired by Galileo's principle of conservation of motion, that is things will
remain in motion unless acted upon by a force. Hobbes used this premise in a
social context and put forth the idea of life is always in motion, and never
without felicity. Felicity means the continuous success in achieving the objects
of desire. Felicity, when combined with the scarcity of resources in the world
would cause conflicts, which will eventually turn into war. He further argues
that when people acquire possessions, they acquire fear as well. They will try
to protect their possessions from thieves and invaders, and thus are constantly
on guard. Either that, or they are just afraid of a preemptive, unprovoked
attack. Hobbes also assumes that human beings are equal by nature. So he says,
any human being can kill another either by brute strength, or by technique or
weapons, or forming a team against another. In his explanation, the power that
someone possesses today is a means to obtain some future good for themselves. In
other words, power today helps to achieve desires of the future, so people will
always seek power over others. Hence, in the state of nature nothing can be
unjust, every person has the liberty to act as they think fit to preserve their
'right of nature', so there is no place or reason for morality. Hobbes's
solution is to have a sovereign who would put laws in place and punish people
who wouldn't obey those.
</p>

<p>
Paraphrasing his famous paragraph from Leviathan,
</p>

<p>
"Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of war, where every man is Enemy
to every man; the same is consequent to the time, wherein men live without other
security, than what their own strength, and their own invention shall furnish
them with all. In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the
fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no
Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no
commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as
require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time;
no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continue all in
fear, and danger of violent death; And the life of man…, solitary, poor,
nasty, brutish, and short.”
</p>

<p>
John Locke(1632-1704) disagreed with Hobbes's idea in many parts, but Locke's
counter arguments had God factor in it as the reason why no one has natural
right to harm another in his life. Interestingly, Locke says that in the state
of nature, there will be a natural right held by each to punish those who harm
another person's life, liberty or property. Right to punish is seen different
from the right to self defence, which is claimed as a right by Hobbes. Locke
thinks that moral law-abiding citizens will come together with the victim to
bring the villain to justice. One key difference is that Locke thinks there will
be no deep scarcity of goods in the world.
</p>

<p>
Locke assumes that human beings are naturally free, equal, and independent. This
means that they are not naturally under the authority of any other person.
Accordingly, Locke concluded that the only way of coming under another person's
authority was to give that person your consent punishment. This holds, for
Locke, whether the person claiming authority is another private individual or
the sovereign. Thus the sovereign, who claims authority over you, has no right
to that authority unless you have voluntarily put yourself in this position
through your own consent.
</p>

<p>
Jean-Jacques Rousseau(1712-1778) agrees with Locke about Hobbes being wrong of
extreme scarcity in the state of nature, but disagrees about the ideas of
morality as the motivation for goodness in the state of nature. Instead he
proposes natural pity or compassion as the element that will rescue humanity
from killing each other.
</p>

<p>
Essentially, for the social contract theorists after Hobbes, the state is
justified if, but only if, every individual over which it claims authority has
consented. Consent, that is keyword. That's probably what caused the
discontinuity in the hitherto way of life. Well, I would like to leave you with
few questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can you think of life in the state of nature if you were in it?</li>
<li>What are your natural rights?</li>
<li>What are you thoughts on possessions?</li>
<li>What binds an individual to a state?</li>
<li>Do you give consent?</li>
</ul>
<p>
The intention of this episode is to introduce the alternate thoughts before the
French Revolution which could have been its possible causation. We have
mentioned a few names, and omitted many more. But names are not interesting to
us, it's the ideas and stories that enthral us.  There is more to cover from
this part of history, but an episode's space is rather constrained. It's perhaps
a travesty to omit <i>The Prince</i> by Niccolo Machiavelli(1469-1527) while
discussing alternate thoughts and ideas. Enlightened despotism or absolutism was
also skipped. The idea where monarch agrees that royal power does not come from
divine right but from a social contract whereby a despot was entrusted with the
power to govern through a social contract in lieu of any other governments. We
didn't speak much about collection of knowledge in Encyclopedia, which happened
in this era. The original feminist Mary Wollstonecraft lived in this era. Much,
much more.
</p>

<p>
In the next episode we discuss the terminologies in Political Ideologies, but
for now, I must leave you and this episode with the following quote by the great
German philosopher Immanuel Kant, about the French Revolution:
</p>

<p>
"Such an event," he said, does not consist in important deeds or
misdeeds of men, whereby, what had been great, became little among men, or what
had been little, became great, and . . . old glorious political edifices
disappeared, whereas, in their stead, other ones grew out of the ground.  No;
nothing of the kind! … The revolution of an ingenious people which we have
lived to see, may succeed or fail. It may be filled with such calamities and
atrocities that a righteous man, even if he could be sure to carry it out
luckily, never would decide to repeat the experiment at such a high price. In
spite of all this such a revolution finds, in the minds of all spectators, a
sympathy very near to enthusiasm. . . . Such a phenomenon in the history of
mankind can never be forgotten; because it proves that in human nature there
exists an inclination and disposition to the better which no politician ever
could have been able to predict by summing up the course of former events."
