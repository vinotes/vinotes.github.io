Thakazhi has awarded a free pass into the theme park of his characters' minds;
to its topsy-turvy rides one at a time. An allowance to trespass deep into their
emotions without persecution, to stay abreast with their feelings of existence,
ambition, conformity, judgement, justification, and finally acceptance. You are
cajoled into forgetting self and the author. At no point is one invited to
project their own sensory experiences of joy and plight to that of any
character, nor is asked to care about author's circumstances or
intentions. Death of the author, and oddly enough, also of the reader is
registered. One subconsciously melds into a seaside belonging to Karuthamma, the
protagonist, Chakki, her mother, Chembankunju, her father, Pareekutty, her
lover, Palani, her husband, and their individual soliloquies.
</p>

<p>
There is no question of right and wrong, everyone is so, and so perhaps everyone
is wrong. One would certainly be defiant in attempting to refrain from that
premise, for it might upset our convenience to earmark a villain at the outset.
There isn't a conspicuous one in this story. In essence, love is punished, by
forces invisible - of collective unconscious, orthodoxy, taboo, customs, fear,
righteousness, ambition, gossips, jealousy, helplessness, debt, law of the land,
and ultimately the person inside you.
</p>

<p>
Karuthamma and Pareekutty grew up as childhood mates in a coastal village
unbeknownst to each other that they were to be separated when they get older.
Their love was that of the permanent nest made in each other's mind, and of the
words exchanged and laughter shared. At not point in their life they touch each
other.  Yet he was ruined and she was blamed for their existence. Why were they
deemed guilty? Were they deserving of such a verdict? Of course they were guilty
of living rent free in each other's heads, which also belonged to their family
and the community in which they lived. There is a tax to be paid on thoughts,
especially if one is thinking of love. Even more important was the hubris, their
negligence, towards the supernatural, of their beliefs in traditions and the
omnipresent deity of uncertanities, the <i>'Kadalamma'</i>, the mother of the
ocean. Everyone in that community has had given a tacit consent at birth to be
owned by the ocean and the community they were born into, to its tradition and
rules. Being unamenable to those benchmarks forges an implicit, accused, and
self-accused criminal of invisible thought crimes, of which you cannot be
absolved. Such a deed makes one a bounty, a prey, a victim.
</p>

<p>
One is informed about the ambitious and avaricious father, the astute and
confused mother, and the strong helpless husband. The tragedy extends in the
realisation that one cannot escape the bond of blood, as much as there is no
escape from the bond of love(anuragam); eternally bound by it, in the most cruel
sadomasochist manner, where you constantly reinforce your own conviction that
you are at fault, your life is a burden to others, your love disrupts
peace. Once commited, knowingly or otherwise, there is no redemption,
because it transforms you into your own torturer, to become one's on judge, jury
and executioner.
</p>

<p>
But eventually they will all disappear from your memory for a timeless melody
and an everlasting embrace. By its own inimitable, inexplicable ways, love
always triumphs! When Pareekutty sings his heart out, Kaurthamma will always
walk towards him with the unadulterated clarity and perfect equanimity of
mind. That attraction, like everything else, is also beyond her control, perhaps
aligning with the laws of nature, subduing the ensuing repercussions, whatever
the price may be demanded for that tryst, even if it is the permanent solitude,
love triumphs!
