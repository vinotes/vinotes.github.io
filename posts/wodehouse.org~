Dear Listener,

The only way you can spoil a Wodehouse story is by not reading it.

In this episode we look at the late language maestro, P.G. Wodehouse. This
glimpse is specifically a foreigner perspective, because for the Brits, most
things Wodehousian might be relatable. But what is the irresistible charm that
Wodehousian stories exudes to a teenage boy living in a remote village on a
mountainous high range in tropical south Asia where Jeeves and Blandings Castle
books are treasured?

English has always been a confusing language for foreigners. Their struggle,
when studied along the semantics and phonetics of English presents a satisfying
conclusion that this enigmatic language is nothing but a mish-mash of
self-contradicting words and received paradoxical phrases practised over
multiple millennia; its vocabulary thus enriched with 'stuff' borrowed, stolen
or sometimes grabbed from other places - just like the word 'grab' which has now
been inculcated into the cultural lexicon as an inappropriate but accepted verb
everywhere. The victim languages, albeit complex, are often complete and
superior to English - what you speak is what you write is exactly what others
read in other languages. Have you ever wondered why English language cannot
handle a genre like Magic Realism? Yet, that's a big three letter YET; Yet, the
language survives, rules, why? For all it's frailties, few people managed to put
English words in a certain order that, not just the sentences, but the language
itself became irresistible to the outsiders, and, at the perch of that bunch was
Wodehouse.

To get the novel right, an author needs to perfect four 'P's, says Stephen Fry
in his reminiscence of Wodehouse: Place, People, Plot, and Prose. The place is
more or less unchanging in Wodehousian tales - set in the 18th century
England. Perhaps, we could credit him lucky to have had the friends, family,
surroundings and upbringing for those imperishable characters he created. The
plot, paraphrasing his own words, "if you get the love story correct, then plot
will follow". But, the prose, that's what sets him apart, the way he puts one
word after the other, separated by those impeccable punctuation, and the
interweaving of expanding humour without any vulgarity, but the clever
juxtaposition of play on words in those lines leaves a literary equivalent of
umami in your brains; nobody knows how he did that.

You might be thinking listener, that's all good, but there are about a 100
books, where shall we begin? Whom should I acquaint with first? Is it Bertie
Wooster, Jeeves, Lord Emsworth at Blandings Castle, the Efficient Baxter, or
PSmith with a silent 'P', or the overbearing aunties? Oh, please tell me where
should I begin?


Well, start at Something Fresh.

It is the first book in Blandings Castle series. We are introduced to Blandings
Castle and Lord Emsworth, The Efficient Baxter, and a perfect love story,
ehh.. not between Emsworth and Baxter, but others in the story. Anyway, here are
few lines from the book, that might prod you into picking up your first
Wodehouse.


"The sunshine of a fair spring morning fell graciously upon London town. It was
the sort of morning when air gives us a feeling of anticipation, a feeling that,
on a day like this, things surely cannot go joggling along in a the same dull
groove, a premonition that something romantic and exciting is about to happen to
us."

"Science with a thousand triumphs to her credit, has not yet succeeded in
discovering the correct reply for a young man to make who finds himself in the
appalling position of being apologised to by a pretty girl.

"They made poor old Percy look an absolute ass."
Well, Nature had done that already, but I'm bound to say they improved on
Nature's work. I should think your cousin Percy must have felt like a plucked
chicken."

"Trouble, after all, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder."

"Ashe was becoming conscious of an undercurrent of something not altogether
agreeable in the conversation. It lacked the gay ease of their first
interview. He was not apprehensive lest she might have guessed his secret."

"One does not fall in love with a girl whom one has met only three times. A
moment's reflection enabled him to diagnose his sensations correctly. The odd
impulse to leap across the compartment and kiss her was not love. It was merely
the natural desire of a good hearted young man to be decently chummy with his
species."

"Rupert Baxter, the Earl of Emsworth's indefatigable Private Secretary, was one
of those men whose chief characteristic is a vague suspicion of their fellow
human beings. He did not suspect them of this or that definite crime: he simply
suspected them."


Alright, that should hopefully be the impetus to get you started. Remember, you
can only spoil a Wodehouse story by not reading it.

Happy reading time!

Cheers.
