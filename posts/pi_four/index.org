Welcome to Hitchens' Razor.

Let's jump straight into it. I will thank our sources in the end.

Simply put, "Liberalism was the ideology of the rising middle class,
Conservatism was the ideology of the aristocracy or nobility, and Socialism was
the ideology of the growing working class." writes Andrew Heywood.

In other words, the origins of these three ideologies were associated with the
plight of the working class, aristocracy, and middle class; in different ways.

Let's begin with an anecdote about the origin of the terms 'left', and 'right'.
Do you remember the rendezvous of the Estates-General at the start of French
Revolution? When they gathered, the representatives who sought fundamental
changes to the functioning of the country sat on the left side of the presiding
officer, and the representatives who wanted to preserve the status quo sat on
the right side. In simple terms - on the left were those who wanted change, and
on right were those who resisted it.

The following centuries after the revolution saw this left-right divide
traversing far and wide in space; and it still continues to divide the room. An
ideological watermark has been ever since impressed on all macro global events
and micro coffee shop chats. What changed was the shape of the
spectrum. Originally started as a straight line this eventually been bent by
extreme ideas and actions. It is now best visualised as a horse-shoe spectrum of
ideologies.  The extreme right and extreme left ideologies are reflected on a
convex mirror where their motives and actions seem closer than they appear. They
are hence within a within a kissing distance, and is dangerous.

So, how do we begin to fathom this theory?

Perhaps with the earliest political and ideological duel between Edmund Burke
and Thomas Paine!
* Burke vs Paine - The beginning 
Burke was born in 1729 CE, and Paine was born in 1737 CE. Burke was Irish, Paine
was English. They both supported the American Revolution; that is to say opposed
the English parliament and its monarch on the matter. If you remember our early
episodes in this series, one of the root causes for the American revolution was
Britain demanding more money from its American colonies to make up for the
losses incurred in its involvement in the Seven Years war. Burke and Paine was
against this new taxation on the colonies. Well, then they were friends!

The French also supported the American revolution, you see. They had lost dearly
in the Seven Years war, and sought revenge against their arch rivals, the
British. The bitter resentment was carried on until they helped the American
colonies defeat the British in the revolution. But the moral victory defeated
them materially. The war drove the French Kingdom to bankruptcy. One of the root
causes for the French revolution was the Monarch and his /ancien regime/ trying
to recover the losses by taxing its populace further.

Thomas Paine fully supported the French Revolution. In fact, he was an advisor
to the French National Assembly when they were drafting the new Constitution.

Edmund Burke did not know how to react initially to the revolution. In August
1789, Burke wrote:

"England gazing with astonishment at a French struggle for liberty and not
knowing whether to blame or applaud! The thing indeed, thought I thought I saw
something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it
paradoxical and mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the
old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner"

But, in October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to
compel King Louis XVI to return to Paris, Burke lost it. That event took him to
his boiling point. Burke began to abhor the revolution. So he voiced and printed
words against the revolution and its principles, to which Paine replied
vehemently. And they became bitter rivals.
* Burke
Edmund Burke is considered as the founder or father of conservatism, especially
in Britain. In 1790, he registered his reaction to the revolution in France by
publishing a pamphlet titled, “Reflections on the Revolution in France, and on
the Proceedings in Certain Societies in London Relative to That Event: In a
Letter Intended to Have Been Sent to a Gentleman in Paris.” The rather long
title was then trimmed to the now popular "Reflections on the Revolution in
France".

The 'Certain societies' mentioned in the original title was referring to a
revolutionary society in England which supported Protestantism as the state
religion. This was a peaceful society, not as revolutionary as its name
suggests. The name rather alludes to its admiration of the "Glorious Revolution"
in England in 1688, which deposed the Catholic monarch and replaced him with a
Protestant monarch, thus establishing the victory of parliament over the
crown. The society was also happy about the revolution in France, and supported
the National Assembly. Not just England, but every other neighbouring country
was afraid of the contagious revolution in France spreading to their land. One
has to presume that Burke was worried too. He directly attacked the
revolutionary society in England, the French National Assembly, and the
enlightenment ideas of liberty, natural rights and Constitution. Plus, the wound
left by the Gordon riots in London in 1780, an attack on the Catholics, must have
still been fresh in Burke's mind.

I present a few passages from Burke's reflection on the "Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity" movement in France, and the forming of a constitution by the
National Assembly, nullifying the monarch and his divine authority, He wrote:

"It is known; that armies have hitherto yielded a very precarious and uncertain
obedience to any senate, or popular authority; and they will least of all yield
it to an assembly which is only to have a continuance of two years. The officers
must totally lose the characteristic disposition of military men, if they see
with perfect submission and due admiration, the dominion of pleaders; especially
when they find that they have a new court to pay to an endless succession of
those pleaders; whose military policy, and the genius of whose command, (if they
should have any,) must be as uncertain as their duration is transient. In the
weakness of one kind of authority, and in the fluctuation of all, the officers
of an army will remain for some time mutinous and full of faction, until some
_popular general_, who understands the art of conciliating the soldiery, and who
possesses the true spirit of command, shall draw the eyes of all men upon
himself. Armies will obey him on his personal account.

A few years later, enter Napoleon Bonaparte!

There is only one comparably Cassandra-like prediction, writes Christopher
Hitchens, "that I can call to mind, and that is Rosa Luxemburg’s warning to
Lenin that revolution can move swiftly from the dictatorship of a class to the
dictatorship of a party, to be followed by the dictatorship of a committee of
that party and eventually by the rule of a single man who will soon enough
dispense with that committee."

Next passage. _Of the then French queen, Burke wrote:_

"It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the queen of France, then the
dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never lighted on this orb, which she
hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw her just above the
horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move
in,—glittering like the morning-star, full of life, and splendour, and joy.  I
thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even
a look that threatened her with insult. But the age of chivalry is gone. That of
sophisters, economists, and calculators, has succeeded; and the glory of Europe
is extinguished for ever. Never, never more shall we behold that generous
loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submission, that dignified obedience, that
subordination of the heart, which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the
spirit of an exalted freedom."

_Of the National Assembly and the constitution, Burke wrote:_

"If this monster of a constitution can continue, France will be wholly governed
by the agitators in corporations, by societies in the towns formed of directors
of assignats and trustees for the sale of church lands, attornies, agents,
money-jobbers, speculators, and adventurers, composing an ignoble oligarchy,
founded on the destruction of the crown, the church, the nobility, and the
people. Here end all the deceitful dreams and visions of the equality and rights
of men."

_Of the social contract. Burke wrote:_

"It becomes a partnership not only between those who are living, but between
those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born. Each
contract of each particular state is but a clause in the great primeval contract
of eternal society, linking the lower with the higher natures, connecting the
visible and invisible world, according to a fixed compact sanctioned by the
inviolable oath which holds all physical and all moral natures, each in their
appointed place."

Now let's listen to Paine's reply.
* Paine
Thomas Paine's reply to Burke's pamphlet is equally emphatic. The general tone
could be sampled in the paragraph below:

"As to the tragic paintings by which Mr. Burke has outraged his own imagination,
and seeks to work upon that of his readers, they are very well calculated for
theatrical representation, where facts are manufactured for the sake of show,
and accommodated to produce, through the weakness of sympathy, a weeping
effect. But Mr. Burke should recollect that he is writing history, and not
plays, and that his readers will expect truth, and not the spouting rant of
high-toned exclamation."

and in the following paragraph as well:

"There is scarcely an epithet of abuse to be found in the English language, with
which Mr. Burke has not loaded the French Nation and the National
Assembly. Everything which rancour, prejudice, ignorance or knowledge could
suggest, is poured forth in the copious fury of near four hundred pages. In the
strain and on the plan Mr. Burke was writing, he might have written on to as
many thousands. When the tongue or the pen is let loose in a frenzy of passion,
it is the man, and not the subject, that becomes exhausted."

I include these to show how vicious ideological battles in writing was back
then. Apart from these, most other parts of Paine's reply are rather technical,
and it counters almost every major accusation made by Burke. He has defended the
revolutionary society of England, and the idea of natural and civil rights which
was then zeitgeist. Paine wrote:

"Mr. Burke, on the contrary, denies that such a right exists in the nation,
either in whole or in part, or that it exists anywhere; and, what is still more
strange and marvellous, he says: "that the people of England utterly disclaim
such a right, and that they will resist the practical assertion of it with their
lives and fortunes." That men should take up arms and spend their lives and
fortunes, not to maintain their rights, but to maintain they have not rights, is
an entirely new species of discovery, and suited to the paradoxical genius of
Mr. Burke."

_About Burke's admiration of the queen, and the disappointment in the lost
chivalry, Paine replied:_

"When we see a man dramatically lamenting in a publication intended to be
believed that "The age of chivalry is gone! that The glory of Europe is
extinguished for ever! that The unbought grace of life (if anyone knows what it
is), the cheap defence of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic
enterprise is gone!" and all this because the Quixot age of chivalry nonsense is
gone, what opinion can we form of his judgement, or what regard can we pay to his
facts? In the rhapsody of his imagination he has discovered a world of wind
mills, and his sorrows are that there are no Quixots to attack them."

_About Burke's notion of a social contract needing to be between the living,
dead and the unborn, Paine wrote:_

"Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself in all cases as the
age and generations which preceded it. The vanity and presumption of governing
beyond the grave is the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies. Man has
no property in man; neither has any generation a property in the generations
which are to follow. The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of any other
period, had no more right to dispose of the people of the present day, or to
bind or to control them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or the people
of the present day have to dispose of, bind or control those who are to live a
hundred or a thousand years hence. Every generation is, and must be, competent
to all the purposes which its occasions require. It is the living, and not the
dead, that are to be accommodated. When man ceases to be, his power and his
wants cease with him; and having no longer any participation in the concerns of
this world, he has no longer any authority in directing who shall be its
governors, or how its government shall be organised, or how administered."

_About society, contract and the Constitution, Paine replied:_

"In casting our eyes over the world, it is extremely easy to distinguish the
governments which have arisen out of society, or out of the social compact, from
those which have not; but to place this in a clearer light than what a single
glance may afford, it will be proper to take a review of the several sources
from which governments have arisen and on which they have been founded. They may
be all comprehended under three heads. First, Superstition. Secondly,
Power. Thirdly, The common interest of society and the common rights of man. The
first was a government of priestcraft, the second of conquerors, and the third
of reason."
* Burke vs Paine - The conclusion
Well, if nothing has had been concluded in over 200 years, it would be hard to
conclude anything now. That is the tragedy of social sciences. At any rate, few
observations must be made.
1. First, this exchange of words must have unveiled the general political
   situation of the late 18th century you. Both of them had supporters and
   followers. It certainly has affected our modern world in many ways
2. Edmund Burke is considered as the founder of conservatism now. Whether he
   knew it is arguable. I suppose his writings, especially the /Reflections on
   Revolutions/ has acted as an inspiration in autopsy for the conservatives. It
   doesn't really help us, in this podcast episode to define Conservatism
   really. Nevertheless, it is imperative to be aware of his views with all its
   frailties
3. Burke passage about the French queen might not be palatable for a reader of
   21st century, but if you look around to find similarities, find it you might
   quicker than you would think it might be. Hero worship is still pervasive
4. The most curious comment made by Burke, according to me, the hardest to
   comprehend is regarding the social contract needing to include the living,
   dead and the unborn. Perhaps, we are reading it in an entirely different
   circumstances
5. Burke's triumph is in the Cassandra like prediction of the a powerful
   military general. That was eerily exact!
6. Thomas Paine is not considered the father of liberalism, but it is impossible
   to study or analyse the idea of liberty without Paine. It is as simple as
   that.

   With that, let's move on to the 19th century, where Classical Liberalism and
   Conservatism took its real shape.
