Well, Thakazhi, our doyen author, has awarded a free pass to the topsy-turvy
rides inside of the character's mind, one at a time, completely bypassing the
poet's thoughts. Thakazhi has trespassed so deep into his own characters'
feelings, emotions, judgement, conformity, ambition, acceptance that you are
forced to submit into forgetting self and the author. At no point was I
projecting my own experiences of joy and plight to that of any character, nor
did I care about author's circumstances. Death of the author, and reader was
confirmed. It was all Karuthamma, the protagonist, Chembankunju, her father,
Parikutti, her lover, Palani, her husband, Chakki, her mother, and their
individual soliloquy.

There is no question of right and wrong, everyone is so, and so perhaps everyone
is wrong, even though you would try to refrain to think so - because that
defeats our quest to earmark a villain at the outset. I don't think there is one
in this story.

In essence, love is punished, by forces invisible, of collective unconscious,
orthodoxy, taboo, customs, fear, righteousness, ambition, gossips, jealousy,
helplessness, debt, law of the land, the person inside you.

Karuthamma and Pareekutty
