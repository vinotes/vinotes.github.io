Mighty mountains,
I saw its curves and peaks yonder,
White clouds and blue skies surrounded.
Usual voices inside, as I begin my climb to the top,
Iffy paths or dicey end, I shall not stop.

First came the rain, making my feet wet,
Then came the sun, making my brow sweat.
Pain feasting on my body, but I couldn't care less,
There I crossed a line, and made the trees jealous.

Slippery stones and bottomless slope, flanking,
Clinging mud and flatulent shoes, wringing.
Looking back, the rucksack of things reluctant,
Looking ahead, a view so magnificent.

And my mind must decide quick,
For each step in this trek is a trick.
One clumsy choice could be fatal,
As a life lived with no tale to tell.

Alas, I reached the snow capped summit,
Oh, the joy you get when you truly commit.
White clouds and blue skies saying welcome,
Wind dancing like your pet when you get home.

Sat by the yellow tent, I looked far and wide,
Leaving its nest was a waterfall to my side,
Chasing its petulant river-child running away,
Is when the poet in me awoke with to have a say.

Twilight now flirted with day and night,
Sky blushed as it turned orange, bright.
Adios, I am done for the day, said the setting sun.
'See you on the other side' was Earth's cunning pun.

The river carried mountain's letter to the sea.
The poem rhymed words of passionate love to me.
Fate, they cannot unite; divided by an invisible wall.
Faith! the mountain awaited the next rainfall.

I looked up, now the canvas was painted black,
A full moon and a thousand splendid suns smiled back.
I walked for long, forlorn, mind full of peace.
Mighty mountains, I loved its curves and peaks.
