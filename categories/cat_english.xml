The curse is upon all of us.&lt;br&gt;
But we are not at faults!&lt;br&gt;
To collect thoughts and connect dots.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Curse of love, my love,&lt;br&gt;
Curse of care, brother,&lt;br&gt;
Curse of bond, my friend,&lt;br&gt;
Blood, kin, and beyond.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But, for every curse, there is a chance,&lt;br&gt;
That might seem second at first,&lt;br&gt;
but for a lifetime it will stick with us,&lt;br&gt;
Only if we embrace it at self behest,&lt;br&gt;
Alike the tale of hare and tortoise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hitherto, we lived in parallel lines,&lt;br&gt;
Belated, your smile crossed mine.&lt;br&gt;
Then we spoke, and we laughed,&lt;br&gt;
And then we sang, and we danced.&lt;br&gt;
We are thus aware that we were,&lt;br&gt;
For our purpose, joie de vivre!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are only poems, no poets,&lt;br&gt;
Art owns its own artist.&lt;br&gt;
A deaf maestro's lullaby,&lt;br&gt;
That we could finally,&lt;br&gt;
Feel the friend in you and me,&lt;br&gt;
Where serendipity serenades to our vivacious youth,&lt;br&gt;
And the greatest relief lies in telling the truth.&lt;br&gt;

Pronouns replace a person's name in a sentence. They/Them are pronouns attached
to human beings who identify differently from He/Him or She/Her, the
conventional Male or Female. The application of these words are predominantly in
the English language used in North America, Europe, and Australia. This has
created some debate owing to the singular/plural usage of They/Them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Examples: "Tell them to take care."
"What are they doing?"
"Did they have any food?"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In all of the above sentences, they/them could be interpreted as either singular
or plural. Apparently, native English speakers could convincingly deploy such
usage without causing any confusion. Non-native speakers on the contrary usually
learn English language from grammar books; which explains the syntax and
semantics of they/them to be used as plural to other pronouns. English, even
though the most popular language in the world, lacks an agreed structure. You
might have noticed that what you pronounce is not always what you write. Same
word could morph into a different meaning in a different context. I am not an
expert, but these anomalies are easily noticed by a non-native speaker. Anyway,
the argument is about They/Them and its validity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the core of it, living in a society demands interactions with fellow human
beings. If we were to live in caves, as we used to, then pronouns wouldn't have
mattered much. But now, as a collective, we are past that stage of
civilisation. Of course there is always a war, lack of basic amenities to a
large proportion of population, novel diseases, climate change, and other
crisis, etc., but those are macro-issues. Language on the other hand is
day-to-day, it impact our interactions with our real friends, social media
friends, colleagues, colleagues, and every other person you meet. It is the
fabric of a society. It has continuously evolved, and has been improved,
criticised, adapted over the centuries, and will continue to do so.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>language</category><category>politics</category><category>society</category><guid>https://vinotes.github.io/posts/theythem/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 20:59:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Acting</title><link>https://vinotes.github.io/posts/acting/</link><dc:creator>Vinodh MJ Human</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
Curiouser and Curiouser gets life at every random decision we make. I was
labouring under the delusion that by not bothering to give a try at something,
one was assured to be bad at it. If these words were short and catchy, it would
have become my motto. Does that make any sense? Life is Schrodinger's cat all
over again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bit of background, I moved to a different country to pursue the ever elusive
higher education. Call it the autumn madness, I enrolled for an audition at the
University's drama society. My first audition. All I wanted was to experience
the process, and to mildly irritate the panel with uncouth improvisations. I
auditioned for the role of Guy Tree, a homeless person carelessly wandering into
a farm owned by two sisters. The sisters had inherited the farm from their
recently deceased parents. Sisters adopts Guy Tree into their farm and
household, and he helps them in managing the farm. I was asked to deliver a
monologue of Guy Tree reminiscing his past; living in a busy city with his
parents, and him wanting peace and quiet. When he eventually reach the farm
which is extraordinarily quiet, he finds the silence intolerable. Done. We will
let you know in couple of days. Two days later, I got a recall from the team.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Having no expectations is perhaps our greatest courage to attempt out of the
ordinary deeds. And when someone identifies the petite potential in us, that
discovery becomes the worst form of scaremongering. I was nervous going into the
recall auditions because, around 80 members auditioned for this in the first
round. Majority of them belonged to related fields of study, like Literature,
Drama Studies, Gender Studies, Film Studies etc. I was an Electrical
Engineer. Regardless of the outcome, I convinced myself to enjoy the experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ben, brother of the two sisters running the farm comes into the play. Freddie
played Ben's character. I played Guy Tree. A lengthy conversation between the
generally insecure yet extroverted Ben, and the optimistic but introverted Guy
was to be enacted for the recall auditions. After practising couple of times, we
went into the audition room. The panel were ready when we were ready. For the
fifteen minutes that I acted as Guy Tree, I saw only Ben in Freddie's form and
an imaginary Ewe about to give birth in the corner of the room. The panel
members were invisible to me. I was Guy Tree for that short period. I did not
get the part, but I definitely enjoyed the experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, what I wanted to say was : "Do it".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many Peace.

How can it be put into words?&lt;br&gt;
For love itself is a word, borrowed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Midnight, Manchester.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An otherwise remarkably quiet residential area was woken up by blaring sirens of
what was unmistakably police cars. Peeped through the window to witness a
chase. Unidentified grey car speedily approaching a junction; followed by three
police cars with dancing lights and high-pitched sirens. Grey car trying to
escape into a narrow alleyway only to be stopped by barricades. That path was
clearly reserved for pedestrians supporting climate change. Grey car rammed into
one of the barricades, and that was enough for the police cars to corner it. The
Hero/Villain(just a matter of perspective isn't it?) abandoned the car and ran
for it. Officers followed him. Sirens and dancing light remained in the
junction.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Seven minutes later…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Villain/Hero was now handcuffed and being pushed back towards the junction. The
police searched him to find nothing on him. Searched the grey car and the
officer's hand was reassuringly empty. Another officer asked the Villain/Hero,
"The car is stolen innit?". Officer walked towards the license plate and pulled
it to find another license plate underneath it. "Fornicating hell, you're right",
shouted somebody. The Villain/Thief was arrested and carried away in his
silence. Sirens went off, lights out, grey car was towed away. Remarkably quiet
residential area went back to sleep. I need to get some sleep as well. Tickets
for the new James Bond movie is already booked for tomorrow night show. Well, I
will watch it anyway.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many Peace.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://vinotes.github.io/posts/policechase/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 05:50:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Yellow Balloon</title><link>https://vinotes.github.io/posts/yellow-balloon/</link><dc:creator>Vinodh MJ Human</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
The night, soothingly quiet, Poet awoke in her bed.&lt;br&gt;
Eyes wide, a story unsaid, raging in her head.&lt;br&gt;
She opened her book and started scribbling away,&lt;br&gt;
With hope that the memory of her dream would stay.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lying on a hammock she thought,&lt;br&gt;
About a piquant dream she caught.&lt;br&gt;
An unsaid story that she must tell,&lt;br&gt;
But out of her mind it suddenly fell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was about a familiar young girl,&lt;br&gt;
Who wore a necklace made of pearl.&lt;br&gt;
Ah..! that curious world inside a crystal bowl,&lt;br&gt;
And indeed the villain who made the story whole!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Enter Villain, with a yellow balloon in his hand,&lt;br&gt;
Seven feet tall, skinny lad was all tanned.&lt;br&gt;
With him he brought his own music band,&lt;br&gt;
Popular songs that it played were all banned.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yellow balloon hovered above his head like a halo,&lt;br&gt;
Her eyes twinkled as she went to say hello.&lt;br&gt;
Will you give me that yellow balloon I crave?&lt;br&gt;
Quid pro quo, the pearl necklace, that I will take to my grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The necklace? no, no!&lt;br&gt;
Oh dear, why is that so?&lt;br&gt;
Because you’re the villain in this story!&lt;br&gt;
Yes, but villains are also part of history.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
No, I know, villains always lose in the end.&lt;br&gt;
Right you are! Here, take the balloon my friend.&lt;br&gt;
As she reached out for the balloon, he let it fly,&lt;br&gt;
Ha-ha! where's the fun in not letting it touch the sky.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
She woke up with a start, still lying on her hammock,&lt;br&gt;
The pearl necklace was planted safely on her neck.&lt;br&gt;
Opened her book and started scribbling away,&lt;br&gt;
With hope that the memory of her dream would stay.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The night, soothingly quiet, is coming to its end,&lt;br&gt;
The poet now stood in her balcony facing the cold wind.&lt;br&gt;
Words rhyming on her book, Pearls shining on her neck,&lt;br&gt;
As she smiled at an yellow balloon that dawned up in the sky.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;</description><category>poem</category><guid>https://vinotes.github.io/posts/yellow-balloon/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 06:00:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>City Rain</title><link>https://vinotes.github.io/posts/cityrain/</link><dc:creator>Vinodh MJ Human</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
Like an ancient civilization, the city slept,&lt;br&gt;
In an endless commute, its way of life wept.&lt;br&gt;
In mirky buildings and sulky streets,&lt;br&gt;
Boredom grumbled, and happiness crumbled.&lt;br&gt;
Hither and yon, people ran to make ends meet,&lt;br&gt;
And that's when, the first drop of rain came to greet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
His highness's arrival was announced by Dhol drums,&lt;br&gt;
Boisterously, it lifted the city out of its doldrums.&lt;br&gt;
Bewitched the wind, into a wicked poltergeist,&lt;br&gt;
Possessed the trees like an unseen ghost,&lt;br&gt;
Made them dance with no rhyme, nor reason,&lt;br&gt;
The city was under its spell, in a dry summer season.&lt;br&gt;
Windows were shattered; for wind owes nothing in the end.&lt;br&gt;
Clothes were brandished; so one shall never pretend.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the first drop, across the tar road, he boarded a bus, red,&lt;br&gt;
Sitting by a window, he peered outside - pandemonium appeared.&lt;br&gt;
Citizens with books, and bags, and sarees above their head,&lt;br&gt;
Steam rising, from a packed tea shop in the distance, up ahead,&lt;br&gt;
A woman was wrestling with wind; to ignite a cigarette,&lt;br&gt;
Strolling while nature is mopping; a singular etiquette.&lt;br&gt;
A buoyant umbrella was floating in a whirlwind,&lt;br&gt;
Nature, thus mocking the anticipation of humankind.&lt;br&gt;
The rain gained momentum as the bus coughed forward,&lt;br&gt;
He looked behind and saw memories travelleing backward.&lt;br&gt;
Closed his eyes, the downpour deluged his face with euphoria,&lt;br&gt;
A song surfaced from his childhood that rhymed with liquid nostalgia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the first drop, she picked up the book, her precious company,&lt;br&gt;
The wooden arm chair, beckoned her from the spacious balcony;&lt;br&gt;
Feet up on the chair, rocking back and forth,&lt;br&gt;
She witnessed sky coalesce with earth.&lt;br&gt;
Closed her eyes; her breath flooded heart with petrichor,&lt;br&gt;
Opened the book; her brain vessels capsized in bibliochor.&lt;br&gt;
For once, her heart and brain agreed to this moment,&lt;br&gt;
That purpose of life is - Knowledge - makes one content.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the first drop, they said, let's keep playing,&lt;br&gt;
This can't get any better, keep the ball rolling.&lt;br&gt;
The rain couldn't drench their jerseys wet,&lt;br&gt;
For they were already saturated in sweat.&lt;br&gt;
Raindrops crossing flood lights was quite a sight,&lt;br&gt;
Win this special game, they must, with all their might.&lt;br&gt;
Awaits, a hot water bath, a biryani, and perhaps a drive into the night,&lt;br&gt;
When the city shines bright, and the night grows young until the first light.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the first drop, he sought her presence,&lt;br&gt;
She was not found in their residence.&lt;br&gt;
He looked at the flight of stairs,&lt;br&gt;
Spun on his feet, and went up to the terrace.&lt;br&gt;
There she stood staring at the sky,&lt;br&gt;
Palms open, her hands were lifted shoulder high.&lt;br&gt;
Her pink clothes soaked from head-to-toe,&lt;br&gt;
He moved closer and hugged her apropos.&lt;br&gt;
She stepped on his feet; He kissed on top of her head,&lt;br&gt;
With hands wrapped around his chest, her face rested.&lt;br&gt;
In that chilling juxtaposition, they stood in silence,&lt;br&gt;
Under the rain, they melded into the timeless ambience.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the first drop, Poet moved to the kitchen,&lt;br&gt;
For a cup of tea with a hint of mint and lemon.&lt;br&gt;
The curtains swung over the room irking the shadows,&lt;br&gt;
A venerable fountain pen lay on the table in its repose.&lt;br&gt;
The pen kissed the paper, then and back again,&lt;br&gt;
Until Poet read the words, "City Rain".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="orgc8317df"&gt;Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc8317df"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Day 1 : No reply.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Day 2 : No reply.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, what's the point of being in a messaging ecosystem if we don't yield to
its temptations? To keep the civilization going, one must engage in learned
discourse, vociferous debates and rude emoticon exchanges. Simply put, one must
reply to a friend's message.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Think about it this way:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Millenial Ramayanam. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshmana"&gt;Lakshmanan&lt;/a&gt; on his death bed. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama"&gt;Raman&lt;/a&gt; pings &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman"&gt;Hanuman&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;i&gt;Bro,
ngl, Lak is fried… bad scene… URGENT!… need Sanjeevani ASAP!!!&lt;/i&gt;" Assume a
scenario where Hanuman ignores the text, and Gen-Y Raman is adamant not to make
a phone call to assert the gravity of the situation. It simply ain't cool to
call. Couple of days later Hanuman reaches the base camp, smoking chillum, lit
af, and through the chillum smoke he sees another huge smoke screen in front of
him; understands it is coming from Lakshmanan's funeral pyre, and cries WTAF !!!
Now, Raman has one less thing to worry about, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugriva"&gt;Sugreevan&lt;/a&gt; is still plucking
Tulsi leaves one at a time in a Himalayan valley thinking it must be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjeevani_(plant)"&gt;Sanjeevani&lt;/a&gt;,
going by its smell. What a fate!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, luckily, Hanuman, my hero, your hero, our hero, everyone's hero, replied
immediately "BRB", took the next flight and brought the entire freaking
mountain. The episode ended with a close-up shot of Lakshmanan eating protein
bars and Greek salad on his path to full fitness and Sugreevan is smoking
chillum in the background. Shubham!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My dear friends, moral of the story is that one must reply to their friend's
messages at the earliest.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Jai Hanuman. Many peace.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

For a lifelong Liverpool F.C fan, this is the perfect gift.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I found a poem inside it. My friend Harish, a proud Chelsea F.C fan wrote this&lt;br&gt;
poem. He understands football better than anyone else. Football is mostly&lt;br&gt;
happiness, sometimes sorrow, triumphs and heartbreaks. It is freedom. It is a&lt;br&gt;
religion without animosity. We all love the game and the game loves us&lt;br&gt;
back. Football is love!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://vinotes.github.io/galleries/stevie.jpg" alt="nil"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Do you remember? Is it a blur? Reminisce,&lt;br&gt;
As you sailed through the highs and the lows,&lt;br&gt;
Through the soaring peaks and the infinte abyss,&lt;br&gt;
Darkness, the roll of a dice, chaos, the fall of a domino.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The words of a special anthem echoes&lt;br&gt;
Softly, just like it did in Turkey and Madrid&lt;br&gt;
A wave of red, devoured the green meadows&lt;br&gt;
Millions of souls dreamt, breathless, achieve it they did!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That echo is now a roar, your ears hurt&lt;br&gt;
Do not resist, for it is a beacon of hope&lt;br&gt;
Pull up your socks, be ready and be alert&lt;br&gt;
For even in the face of defeat, you will kop(e)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The walk is now a jog, the road to salvation&lt;br&gt;
The time to show how much you've grown&lt;br&gt;
A fallen tear, broken heart, a whisper, a realisation&lt;br&gt;
For even in lucid dreams, you'll never walk alone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let us travel back to the age of reptiles. Early reptiles understood the need
for world sustainability by reproduction, hence they happily mated, laid eggs
and moved on to next honey moon. Reptile nonchalance is criminally underrated.
They left their eggs to sun and season to hatch. A reptile life thus begins and
ends with its own experiences. Bliss!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Enter the birds. They developed feathers and wings to counter the cold.  They
had intercourse and more eggs were delivered. Then they broke the age old
reptile tradition, and started caring about their eggs by keeping them warm and
guarding them from danger. The first act of true selfishness in the evolution of
Evolution.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mammals! When birds thought hair instead of feathers was perfectly stupid,
mammals came up with the hitherto unknown notion of having sex and storing eggs
inside its own body. Inside the body!!! Such was the shock, bird brains attained
its maximum cognisance and reptiles retired from being related. The mammalian
eggs came out alive from their body and started crying for food. The mountains
and tadpoles echoed the melancholy. Mammals, then acquired the habit of
providing protection and nutrition to the offspring. Thus began the suckling and
tickling. This Mammalian care lead to mutual understanding and association
between the parent and the offspring. The cherishing of the youngling created
attachment, and kindled the possibility of learning by imitation. The beginnings
of true social life.  As H.G.Wells has rightly said, "A &lt;i&gt;teachable&lt;/i&gt; type of life
had come into the world". The student then became the teacher, thoughts replaced
lessons, and life advanced in the world. Here we are!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Secreting or not, all mammalian genders have mammary glands. One gender ceasing
to mature at an early age and another maturing at a later stage.  Unravelling
this bias, a primitive hypothesis suggested that the early mammal children were
truly sexist, and chose to suck nipple(s) of one specific gender while
disdainfully ignoring the other. The continuous process of suckling and sucking
might have caused the growth in the former, and the categorical humiliation
could have hindered the growth in the latter. The fallacious theory dared to
compare Mammae to the ever expanding universe.  Regardless of the intellectual
snobbery, it opened up a new space of body research, which, the Children Of
Science(COS a.k.a Cause) informally called as 'The shape of you'.  Apart from
this, two questions of great fiscal and monetary importance are: "Since when did
one start wearing the inevitable as an embellishment to poverty, and the other
consider this evolutionary augmentation as a world wonder"?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The United League Of Nations(TULON), is seriously contemplating re-introduction
of &lt;i&gt;'Mulakkaram'&lt;/i&gt;, loosely translated to Breast Tax, which, till the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;
century, was the tax imposed on lower caste women if they wanted to cover their
breasts in public. The women were expected to pay the government a tax on their
bosom, as soon as they started developing them. The tax collectors would visit
every house to collect Breast(Either of the two fleshy milk-secreting glandular
organs on the chest of a woman) tax from any lower caste women who passed the
age of puberty. The tax was evaluated by the collectors depending on the size of
their breasts. An American newspaper casually called it as "The Cover Charge",
and people laughed for seven consecutive days. Later, they were all hanged,
drawn and quartered for the simple crime of shamelessness. The current
generation of people in this geographical area unanimously agreed that they are
ashamed of their ancestry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The famous English thought on "To cover or not to cover" continues to baffle the
intelligent society. An armchair thinker once said: "A man went outside a bar
and looked behind to find it sacrilegious; but from the inside he found it
perfectly ordinary". In some parts of the world, people are happy not covering
their body or smile, whereas in some other parts of the world covering head to
toe is the stepping stone to nirvana. Rest of the world believes in heuristic
principles.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To abruptly end is merciful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many peace.
