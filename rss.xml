I read about hypocognition recently in an &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/hypocognition-is-a-censorship-tool-that-mutes-what-we-can-feel"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; shared by my friend. It is a
state, where a feeling, a concept, or a phenomenon cannot be put into words.
For example, what's the word for &lt;i&gt;the vague uncomfortable feeling of sitting on
a seat that is still radiating warmth from someone else’s bottom&lt;/i&gt;? It is called
&lt;i&gt;Shoeburyness&lt;/i&gt;. I had such an experience, not shoeburyness, that, I have had in
many a wonderful occasions. Hypocognition happened.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think, therefore I am sometimes able to enjoy certain moments of exquisite
intellectual pleasure of knowing that a completely unknown person in the world,
dead or alive, has resonated with your thoughts. Once, I was in a bed and I
thought: "There are certain things in the world which will not bend to
force. Things, that cannot be acquired by power, but are presented by faith and
happiness. &lt;b&gt;Love!&lt;/b&gt; I strongly believe that love is for those who deserve it. The
wealthiest human cannot find an ounce of love any of the shops in the world. The
strongest human can never feel love through arm wrestling. Love cannot be
snatched, bought or bartered. That's where the satisfaction of giving is
born. If you can, ask a dog about it."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Books are wonderful objects. My friend might think me queer to call it an
object. People think books have feelings. I too have thought so. Currently, I am
reading Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. Today, I read this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Siddhartha&lt;/b&gt; : "Oh, he's strong, the Samana, and he isn't afraid of anything. He
could force you, beautiful girl. He could kidnap you. He could hurt you."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Kamala&lt;/b&gt; : "No, Samana, I am not afraid of this. Did any Samana or Brahman ever
fear, someone might come and grab him and steal his learning, and his religious
devotion, and his depth of thought? No, for they are his very own, and he would
only give away from those whatever he is willing to give and to whomever he is
willing to give. Like this it is, precisely like this it is also with Kamala and
with pleasures o love. Beautiful and red is Kamala's mouth, but just try to kiss
it against Kamala's will, and you will not obtain a single drop of sweetness
from it, which knows how to give so many sweet things! You are learning easily,
Siddhartha, thus you should also learn this: love can be obtained by begging,
buying, receiving it as a gift, finding it in the street, but it cannot be
stolen. In this, you have come up with the wrong path. No, it would be a pity,
if a pretty young man like you would want to tackle it in such a wrong manner."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Resonating thoughts!

എന്താണ് നഷ്ടപ്പെട്ടതെന്ന് എനിക്കറിയില്ല. നഷ്ടങ്ങളെ ചിട്ടപ്പെടുത്തുവാൻ നമുക്കാവില്ല. നഷ്ടത്തിന്
കനമുണ്ടെന്ന് മാത്രം അറിയാം.  അതെന്താണെന്നെന്നു പോലും അറിയാതെ, ആ കനമാണ് നമ്മൾ
താങ്ങുന്നത്. നഷ്ടത്തിന് ഒരു രൂപസങ്കല്പം നൽകാമെങ്കിൽ അത് ഒരു ബുദ്ധിമാനായ
വേതാളത്തിന്റേതാവണം. തോളിലിന്നുരുന്ന് അത് നമ്മുടെ ചെവിയിൽ കുസൃതികഥകൾ പറയുന്നു. അതിന്റെ ഉത്തരം
ആലോചിച്ചു നമ്മൾ തല പുകയ്ക്കുന്നു.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
എന്തിനും ഏതിനും അതിന്റെതായ ഒരു കാരണമുണ്ടെന്നു യുക്തിവാദികൾ പറയും. അവർക്ക് അത് മറ്റുള്ളവരെ കുറിച്ച്
മാത്രമേ പറയാനാവൂ. സ്വന്തം കാര്യം വരുമ്പോൾ, കാരണമെന്തെന്ന് തെളിച്ചു അറിയാമെങ്കിൽ പോലും, അവർക്ക് അത്
മനസ്സിലാവുന്നില്ല. അത് അർത്ഥശൂന്യമാണെന്ന് ഉറച്ചു വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നു . 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
നഷ്ടബോധം, ഐക്യൂ കുറഞ്ഞ ഒരു നല്ല നായാട്ടുകാരനെ പോലെയാണ്. എത്ര വട്ടം ആവർത്തിച്ച് പറഞ്ഞാലും തലയിൽ കേറില്ല, പക്ഷെ ഒരിക്കലും
തെറ്റാത്ത ഉന്നത്തോടെ അത് സമനിലയെ വേട്ടയാടുന്നു.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://mindtoilet.github.io/posts/nashtam/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 23:32:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Make us dream!</title><link>https://mindtoilet.github.io/posts/a-football-dream/</link><dc:creator>mind</dc:creator><description>&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Liverpool FC is my football club. Palakkad is my beautiful home town in Kerala, India.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had a dream.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Liverpool FC came to Palakkad to play a football game. Sadio Mane
started on the bench, but he chose to stand with the fans. As he was 
watching the game, a confident young man stood next to him.
Naturally, they became friends. Unforeseen, as is usually the 
case with nature, the game was cancelled few minutes into it.
I asked Sadio, “Will you play football with us in my school?“
He said yes. So I took him to Navodaya Vidyalaya, Palakkad, the best
school in the world. I introduced Sadio to my friends and they all
were ready for a game.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://mindtoilet.github.io/galleries/NavodayaGround.JPG" alt="nil"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sadio fell in love with the ground the moment he saw it. Western
ghats in the backdrop and the amazing Palakkadan wind made him whisper:
“This is where I want to play day in day out”. Sadio played in my team's attack and I
played in the midfield. When my goalkeeper played a simple ball to me, I
looked up the field and saw Sadio making the run. With my barefoot, I
sliced the ball and it was airborne. Seconds later, that touch by
Sadio, and the finish, the ball was in the back of the net. The trend
continued, he made those runs, and I sent him through on the goal.
We won!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After the post match handshake and hug, Sadio asked me: “Why don’t you
come to Melwood some day?”  in French obviously. I smiled, and said
“Oui, I will try. Merci beaucoup”.  Sadio flew back to England. &lt;br&gt;
In the plane, he spoke to a man called Jurgen Klopp. Mr. Klopp spoke to
someone and a week later, I got a call from Liverpool FC, the best
football club in the world.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I landed in John Lennon airport. Imagine all the people, waiting for me. &lt;br&gt;
I reached Melwood, Liverpool FC's training ground.
Sadio introduced me to his friends. Virgil was taller than me. 
Trent is younger than me. Robbo warned me about Millie's humour sense. 
Mo's English was better than mine. I gave Ali a
chocolate and he kept it. I told Bobby he is my favourite player. The
boss gave me hug and said welcome. I was home.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I wore my boots for evening's training session. Sadio told the boss that
he wanted me to play in his side. I scored one, assisted twice, made a
goal saving tackle and broke my ankle. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hendo lifted the ball onto Mo's path, who cut it back to Bobby,
who nonchalantly flick into the space behind Virgil.
I was too quick for the big man. Blink of an eye,
I slotted the ball past Adrian and performed a Bobby celebration.
Then Allison played a simple ball to me, I looked up the field and saw Sadio making
the run.  I sliced the ball and it was airborne.  Seconds later, that
touch by Sadio and the finish, the ball was in the back of the
net. The second assist followed a neat link up play between Bobby, Mo,
Sadio and Me.  Bobby's no look finish met my cross at the far
post. Jurgen's celebration to that was wild.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I might have kicked the wall too hard. That's how I woke up with a
broken ankle, but it was definitely worth the dream. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
YNWA!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://mindtoilet.github.io/galleries/dhanteras.JPG" alt="nil"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Mighty mountains, I dreaded its peaks and curves,&lt;br&gt;
But the spirit indomitable inside, settled my nerves.&lt;br&gt;
So, I climbed and climbed to the top,&lt;br&gt;
leaving behind my past; I did not stop.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First came the rain, making my feet wet,&lt;br&gt;
then came the sun, making my brow sweat.&lt;br&gt;
I crossed a line that made the trees jealous,&lt;br&gt;
Pain building in my body, but I could not care less.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My mind must make that crucial decision,&lt;br&gt;
which stone to tread on next in this expedition.&lt;br&gt;
For choosing the wrong step could be as fatal,&lt;br&gt;
as living a life, without an adventure to tell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Alas, I saw my yellow tent by the riverside,&lt;br&gt;
On a valley alike a silver necklace on a bride.&lt;br&gt;
Stretched my shape, and washed my face,&lt;br&gt;
with water so cold that set my wits ablaze.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Twilight flirted with day and night,&lt;br&gt;
Sky blushed as it turned orange, bright.&lt;br&gt;
Adios, I am done for the day, said the setting Sun.&lt;br&gt;
'See you on the other side' was Earth's cunning pun.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The river carried mountain's letter to the sea.&lt;br&gt;
The poem rhymed words of passionate love to me.&lt;br&gt;
Fate, they cannot unite; divided by an invisible wall.&lt;br&gt;
Faith! the mountain still awaited the next rainfall.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Have you been waiting for something all your life?&lt;br&gt;
I walked in the dark for long, forlorn, with an inner strife.&lt;br&gt;
Then I stopped and looked up, now the canvas was painted black;&lt;br&gt;
An imperial white moon and a thousand splendid suns smiled back.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What happened?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was reading a book, and suddenly heard a loud noise from outside.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you please elaborate?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's what sir, BANG!, and seconds later, a second BANG.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will you be able to recreate your evening till the incident?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yes, sir. Yesterday I came back late from work, to attend two more late evening
meetings. Ms. Elusive Luck's birthday, &lt;b&gt;my god&lt;/b&gt;, both meetings got cancelled 
at my arrival. So, I practised music for what I thought was an hour.
Sir, It was a good workout, and by the end I was sweating and shivering
from forehead to heels. I wrapped the set, and was hungrily wandering indoors.
That's when i saw the most beautiful thing on my study table. A banana!
Who keeps a banana on a study table, sir? Well, I did, yesterday morning. 
Sync sir, Unbelievable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alright, then what?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sir, i thought of cooking dinner. Dosa in my mind, I found couple of duck eggs
in the fridge. 'Egg Dosa' creeped, sorry, crept into my head. I fetched Dosa
batter and eggs to the warmth outside. Roasted some curry leaves, and ground
them with chillies into a lush green paste. Fried some Coin Pappads as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An eerie silence lurked in the kitchen while I was chopping onions. I added
salt and a pinch of turmeric to the onions. Then I introduced our dear eggs
to Madame la Guillotine, CRACK! its viscous yellow head crashed into the bowl.
I stirred a motley mixture with all that. When the pan on the stove started
whispering to the winds, i threw a water blanket over it. The pan hissed
and shot sodium-in-water sorta tantrums at me. I calmly slid the hot bubbling
bubbles into the sink. Then I painted a solar system on the pan with batter.
The system had to be perfect. A subtle press in the center was by followed by
concentric Sufi whirling. It must spread into a round Gaussian distribution,
and scatter a Brownian motion of batter pores. The pores would channel the 
steam upwards, cooking the layers above en route its itinerary. Then, i
sprayed oil, and smeared the lush green paste on top of the maturing Dosa.
Few seconds later, I massaged the duck egg mash on the green pasture.
Juxtaposition, hitherto unrealistic, was accomplished.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sir, I flipped the Dosa, and waited for the other side to get cooked, flipped it
again, and kept the Dosa aside. Made one more Dosa like that, sir. Later, I ate
both Dosas with Maple syrup, Chammanthi Podi, and Coin pappads sir.  
Sync sir, Unbelievable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is a Chammanthi podi?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Sir, this ain't the appropriate time sir. Maybe later.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Then?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had a pear, drank 350ml of water, brushed my teeth, wrote a blog post, washed
my legs, and went to bed. I continued reading the book "To kill a mockingbird",
when suddenly heard a loud noise from outside sir.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is that it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes sir.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Well, write down your address and phone number. You will have to come to the&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;police station when called upon, to give your statement about yesterday's&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;incident.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Done deal, sir. Many peace.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The sky was clear and the occasion was auspicious, all set to witness the unwitnessed. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Misogynist-Feminist wedding!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The cool breeze from the east moved her jet black hair to his teeth.
He stopped grinning at once. 
No one was invited to their wedding, but they were facing a sea of 
willing crowd to this fictional reality. When the news was whispered 
to them on a hot summer day, they were all &lt;i&gt;thunderstruck&lt;/i&gt;, 
and screamed in unison, "What the"!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The ceremony began with frowns. The crowd murmured incessantly. 
They argued the male was feminist, and misogynist female; 
said it was a marriage made in paradox not paradise.
When the couple vowed to make each other successful, 
old women in the crowd lifted their hands to mouth in pure shock.
Maybe, the crowd was not ready for this, it was way ahead of their time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, the &lt;i&gt;Cardinals of language&lt;/i&gt; convened in a brand new library.
&lt;i&gt;Grammar goons&lt;/i&gt; waited outside with Safety pins and Clown hats.
They were angry at the innate irony of the scheme, thought it to be a joke;
their honor and semantics being dragged through mud. A lesson must be taught.
The infidels should be ostracized from dictionaries at the least. At last,
the convention decided to punish them with the &lt;i&gt;punishment-that-shall-never-be-given&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A huge drama followed, and the couple lived happily ever-after.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today morning, I posted a message in multiple chat groups.&lt;br&gt;
Clearly, the world around me was not ready for this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org6c1f511" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org6c1f511"&gt;&lt;code&gt;The message&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6c1f511"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"&lt;i&gt;Today is Wednesday, 28 March 2018&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org79bb845" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org79bb845"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Buddy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org79bb845"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
yes bro!&lt;br&gt;
What's on today?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This guy is jobless.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgdb6ff2f" class="outline-2"&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdb6ff2f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What am I missing with this date?&lt;br&gt;
Did you integrate your messaging app with emacs?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since most dates in the calendar are earmarked '&lt;i&gt;exciting&lt;/i&gt;', a boring&lt;br&gt;
date brings natural suspicion.&lt;br&gt;
About the pure evil second comment, &lt;code&gt;Dislike is directly proportional to ignorance&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orge329cd2" class="outline-2"&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge329cd2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yup it is. Good morning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Class is permanent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Any deadline?&lt;br&gt;
Is it your birthday?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hardworking professionals makes the Queen smile.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgb342b09" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgb342b09"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Another group&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb342b09"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

🤔🤔&lt;br&gt;
Our mutual friend's birthday?&lt;br&gt;
yes&lt;br&gt;
👍&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our mutual friend is not part of this group.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org353d5af" class="outline-2"&gt;

Only our hero can solve this puzzle&lt;br&gt;
It’s not my bday 😏&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She is sure it is not her birthday. Good, one less job for our hero.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgc7d4d90" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgc7d4d90"&gt;&lt;code&gt;General mass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc7d4d90"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Who didn't reply in the chat group, because they wish to maintain text message&lt;br&gt;
virginity in the social messaging ecosystem. I applaud that. After all,&lt;br&gt;
the second most important thing in the world is virginity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What's up with today? &lt;i&gt;x5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anything special? &lt;i&gt;x3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Why did you post that? People would think there is something odd.&lt;br&gt;
What was that about? &lt;i&gt;x7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many Peace.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Director is waiting in the car.&lt;br&gt;
Assistant enters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Stanley, they are not laughing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: What do you mean they aren't laughing?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Did you hear them not laughing? It is a comedy movie.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: I know sir. But there is no laughter. Humour is hiding.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Ridiculous, ridiculous. The script was hilarious. I wrote it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: They are just silent sir. There is a powerful sound vacuum.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: But, I remember it was funny. Didn't it tickle your funny bone?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Yes sir, it did tickle me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: The actors also were hysterical during the filming.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: They had time of their life doing what I told them to do.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Right Sir. They did laugh their bottoms up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Why are the audience such cretins?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: I don't know sir. But some of them even left in between the show.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: That's cold blooded comedy blasphemy!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: I couldn't take it as well sir. That's why I came out to tell you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Thanks Amy. Let's get out of here. Where is our driver?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: I think he inside the hall watching the movie.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Thank goodness, at least the boy has some sense of humour.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Sir, here he comes. In his face, I see, Sir … Satisfaction!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Wonderful, Wonderful!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Driver enters…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: David, Did you enjoy it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Tell us, how was it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;: It was relaxing. Thanks for asking.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Thank God. All that not in vain.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Is it over already? I thought it went for another 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;: Sorry what? No, I finished it quickly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Were you not in the theater?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Watching the movie?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;: Oh, no.. no.. I was in the toilet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; I sit?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Sure.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; This is good.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Is that water?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; Yes.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; I'm from the future.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Right.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Your people visit a lot these days. Are you a tourist?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; No, I am a Zogerlog.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; New kind?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; No, one of the oldest.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Is it true that future is not time bound?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; Future is place.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Well present is time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; So what brings you here?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; Sex.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Does sex has a different meaning in future?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; Sex is void in future.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Right. What kind of sex?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; Find out. Suggestions?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Go by the books.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; No good. Confuse.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Really? When did you land?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; land?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; When did you try sex?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tomorrow&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; You mean yesterday.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; No, tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Alright. What happened?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; The power go off. Internet loss.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; So?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; Stream interrupt at 78.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Interesting. Why didn't you download it upfront ?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; Space waste.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Did you finish it then?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; No. Reschedule. Suggestions?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Well, how can I send you a link? Do you have a cellphone?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; No cellphone. If you browse, I copy history.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; Copy. Thanks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Wait. Not that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; Copy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Not that either.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; That?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; That.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; Copy. Thanks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/b&gt; Peace.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org292083a"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This blog about writing blogs is upon request by pestering
friends. Thanks to all other blogs about writing blogs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgb70ad56" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgb70ad56"&gt;&lt;code&gt;To know these exist&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb70ad56"&gt;
&lt;table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides"&gt;


&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col class="org-left"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;

&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col class="org-left"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th scope="col" class="org-left"&gt;&lt;a href="https://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;td class="org-left"&gt;A special work place without pollution&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Curious Columbus-es should then follow the links.
(or) If you just want to get your blog up and running then,
bother not, you shall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org936ed83" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org936ed83"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Well&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org936ed83"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea is to create a blogging website hosted in &lt;i&gt;Github&lt;/i&gt;, using a
static site generator software &lt;i&gt;Nikola&lt;/i&gt;, with the help of &lt;i&gt;Python
virtual environment&lt;/i&gt; and then write blog posts using &lt;i&gt;emacs org mode&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org9128d01" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org9128d01"&gt;Also&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9128d01"&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm using Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will be assuming the name of your blog as 'bottle'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgcfb74cd" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgcfb74cd"&gt;&lt;code&gt;GitHub&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcfb74cd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; : &lt;i&gt;(British)&lt;/i&gt; a foolish or worthless person
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
– Merriam-Webster
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, keeping that in mind:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a GitHub account with username 'bottle'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a repository with the following name:'bottle.github.io'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/"&gt;Instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once done this, GitHub will host your website in the following
address(URL) : &lt;a href="https://bottle.github.io/"&gt;https://bottle.github.io/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Clone(copy) this newborn repository into your local machine a.k.a
personal computer by using the following command:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git clone https://bottle.github.io/ &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/projects/bottle
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You will be adding blog posts in ~/projects/bottle directory and will
push them back to GitHub later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org45f1533" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org45f1533"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Python Virtual Environment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org45f1533"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you haven't heard the news yet, Python is a programming
language and Python 3 is here to stay.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Python Virtual environment basically copies python scripts to create a
new workplace. You could install custom python packages specific to your
project. This means packages used for one project will not pollute
another project.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For e.g. if you wish to have a separate working environment for
cooking vegetables, where you don't want nikola to be installed, 
create a virtual environment called vegetables. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgbb340bd" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="orgbb340bd"&gt;Virtual environment wrapper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbb340bd"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Gift-wrapped python virtual environment commands.
For ease of use. No need to remember too many virtualenv commands.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Let "$HOME/virenvs" be our directory for all environments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;As always, names doesn't matter. It is what you do that defines you - Spiderman's ex-girlfriend&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org3addd03" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org3addd03"&gt;Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3addd03"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Make sure you have pip (python package manager) installed in your machine.
And follow the steps :
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenvwrapper
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;WORKON_HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/virenvs
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
mkvirtualenv bottle
workon bottle
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now you should see that you have entered the 'bottle' environment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org2bce832" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org2bce832"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Nikola&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2bce832"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you are inside the bottle, then you are ready to install &lt;i&gt;nikola&lt;/i&gt;, the
static site generator.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgc1a0174" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="orgc1a0174"&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc1a0174"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install --upgrade pip &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Nikola[extras]'&lt;/span&gt;
nikola plugin -i orgmode
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/projects/bottle
git checkout -b sources
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
add a .gitignore file to &lt;code&gt;$HOME/projects/bottle&lt;/code&gt; folder with the
following content in it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;*.py&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;cod&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
__pycache__
cache
output
.doit.db
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
commit this to git
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git add .gitignore
git commit -m &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Add .gitignore"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgcab6eb6" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="orgcab6eb6"&gt;Website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcab6eb6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Create a website using nikola
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nikola init bottle
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fill in the form that follows.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It should show a success message after form is filled.
Now, nikola will create a new folder called bottle inside
&lt;code&gt;$HOME/projects/bottle&lt;/code&gt;, which is unnecessary. So move its contents to
&lt;code&gt;$HOME/projects/bottle&lt;/code&gt; folder and delete the extra bottle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;mv my_first_site/* .
rm -r my_first_site
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Your new site 'bottle' can be viewed either locally or globally(using
a new technology called internet). The latter will be done later.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To view your recently created site locally, 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nikola build
nikola serve
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Open browser and enter &lt;i&gt;localhost:8000&lt;/i&gt; in the URL bar !
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To stop the localhost web service in the terminal hit Ctrl-c.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org923d661" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org923d661"&gt;Posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org923d661"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, you would want to flush your ideas into blogs. That could be
easily accomplished.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nikola new_post -e
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The -e option will open the post in your text editor of choice;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Movimg on from editor of your choice,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a id="orgefed946"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Emacs Org-mode&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgefed946"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Every great software application is a file with some text in it and
&lt;code&gt;Emacs is a text file editor&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The best way to get started with Emacs is to follow its built-in
tutorial. Open Emacs and press Ctrl-h t. 
Emacs tastes best when customized. Help is available at &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/"&gt;using emacs&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
org-mode in itself is the biggest reason people fall in love with
Emacs so easily. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4"&gt;I like org mode introduction by Harry Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Two cool things in org-mode that I must mention:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating tables &lt;code&gt;|Name|Age &amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exporting to html/pdf/LaTeX/odt/iCal … &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-c Ctrl-e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a id="org6c82171"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To write a new blog post in Emacs org-mode&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6c82171"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You've already installed org mode plugin for nikola in your
installation process. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, append the following to your &lt;code&gt;conf.py&lt;/code&gt; file(available in bottle
folder)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Add the orgmode compiler to your COMPILERS dict.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;COMPILERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"orgmode"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'.org'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Add org files to your POSTS, PAGES&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;POSTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;POSTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"posts/*.org"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"posts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"post.tmpl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PAGES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PAGES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"stories/*.org"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"stories"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"story.tmpl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, to write a post using org-mode,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nikola new_post -e -f orgmode
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org144f304" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org144f304"&gt;Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org144f304"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you like using disqus as the commenting system then:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a disqus account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Login and click on your picture at top right and select install on site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill in necessary details. If you don't see nikola platform in the
list, don't worry, skip that and go to next page. If the next page is about
installing manually by adding code where you want disqus to appear,
SKIP that as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the last step and finish the configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of setup, you should see your disqus short name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is your disqus ID you need to add in your &lt;code&gt;conf.py&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# To use comments, you can choose between different third party comment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# systems.  The following comment systems are supported by Nikola:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#   disqus, facebook, googleplus, intensedebate, isso, livefyre, muut&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# You can leave this option blank to disable comments.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;COMMENT_SYSTEM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"disqus"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# And you also need to add your COMMENT_SYSTEM_ID which&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# depends on what comment system you use. The default is&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# "nikolademo" which is a test account for Disqus. More information&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# is in the manual.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;COMMENT_SYSTEM_ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"your_disqus_account_id"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org8b2cd75" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org8b2cd75"&gt;Publish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8b2cd75"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org4918c66" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org4918c66"&gt;To launch the site in local host&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4918c66"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nikola build
nikola serve
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The 'nikola auto' command automatically updates the local site for
every change you make to your post.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nikola auto
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org7f1433a" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org7f1433a"&gt;To publish your blog to the so called internet,&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7f1433a"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Edit the &lt;code&gt;conf.py&lt;/code&gt; file and change these following variables. This helps
in keeping the master branch of GitHub page less crowded.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GITHUB_SOURCE_BRANCH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'sources'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;GITHUB_DEPLOY_BRANCH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'master'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nikola github_deploy
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And visit &lt;a href="https://bottle.github.io"&gt;https://bottle.github.io&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgfad0dcb" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgfad0dcb"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Thanks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfad0dcb"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
