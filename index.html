<b><i>What happened?</i></b><br></p>

<p>
I was reading a book, and suddenly heard a loud noise from outside.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>Can you please elaborate?</i></b><br></p>

<p>
That's what sir, BANG!, and seconds later, a second BANG.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>Will you be able to recreate your evening till the incident?</i></b><br></p>

<p>
Yes, sir. Yesterday I came back late from work, to attend two more late evening<br>
meetings. Ms. Elusive Luck's birthday, <b>my god</b>, both meetings got cancelled<br>
at my arrival. So, I practised music for what I thought was an hour.<br>
Sir, It was a good workout, and by the end I was sweating and shivering<br>
from forehead to heels. I wrapped the set, and was hungrily wandering indoors.<br>
That's when i saw the most beautiful thing on my study table. A banana!<br>
Who keeps a banana on a study table, sir? Well, I did, yesterday morning.<br>
Sync sir, Unbelievable.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>Alright, then what?</i></b><br></p>

<p>
Sir, i thought of cooking dinner. Dosa in my mind, I found couple of duck eggs<br>
in the fridge. 'Egg Dosa' creeped, sorry, crept into my head. I fetched Dosa<br>
batter and eggs to the warmth outside. Roasted some curry leaves, and ground<br>
them with chillies into a lush green paste. Fried some Coin Pappads as well.<br></p>

<p>
An eerie silence lurked in the kitchen while I was chopping onions. I added<br>
salt, and a pinch of turmeric to the onions. Then I introduced our dear eggs<br>
to Madame la Guillotine, CRACK!, its viscous yellow head crashed into the bowl.<br>
I stirred a motley mixture with all that. When the pan on the stove, started<br>
whispering to the winds, i threw a water blanket over it. The pan hissed,<br>
and shot sodium-in-water sorta tantrums at me. I calmly slid the hot bubbling<br>
bubbles into the sink. Then, I painted a solar system on the pan with batter.<br>
The system had to be perfect. A subtle press in the center was by followed by<br>
concentric Sufi whirling. It must spread into a round Gaussian distribution,<br>
and scatter a Brownian motion of batter pores. The pores would channel the<br>
steam upwards, cooking the layers above en route its itinerary. Then, i<br>
sprayed oil, and smeared the lush green paste on top of the maturing Dosa.<br>
Few seconds later, I massaged the duck egg mash on the green pasture.<br>
Juxtaposition, hitherto unrealistic, was accomplished.<br></p>

<p>
Sir, I flipped the Dosa, and waited for the other side to get cooked, flipped it<br>
again, and kept the Dosa aside. Made one more Dosa like that, sir. Later, I ate<br>
both Dosas with Maple syrup, Chammanthi Podi, and Coin pappads sir.<br>
Sync sir, Unbelievable.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>What is a Chammanthi podi?</i></b><br>
Sir, this ain't the appropriate time sir. Maybe later.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>Then?</i></b><br></p>

<p>
I had a pear, drank 350ml of water, brushed my teeth, wrote a blog post, washed<br>
my legs, and went to bed. I continued reading the book "To kill a mockingbird",<br>
when suddenly heard a loud noise from outside sir.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>Is that it?</i></b><br>
Yes sir.<br></p>

<p>
<i>Well, write down your address and phone number. You will have to come to the</i><br><i>police station when called upon, to give your statement about yesterday's</i><br><i>incident.</i><br></p>

<p>
Done deal, sir. Many peace.<br></p>

<p>
The sky was clear and the occasion was auspicious, all set to witness the unwitnessed.<br></p>

<p>
<i>The Misogynist-Feminist wedding!</i><br></p>

<p>
The cool breeze from the east moved her jet black hair to his teeth.<br>
He stopped grinning at once.<br>
No one was invited to their wedding, but they were facing a sea of<br>
willing crowd to this fictional reality. When the news was whispered<br>
to them on a hot summer day, they were all <i>thunderstruck</i>,<br>
and screamed in unison, "What the"!<br></p>

<p>
The ceremony began with frowns. The crowd murmured incessantly.<br>
They argued the male was feminist, and misogynist female;<br>
said it was a marriage made in paradox not paradise.<br>
When the couple vowed to make each other successful,<br>
old women in the crowd lifted their hands to mouth in pure shock.<br>
Maybe, the crowd was not ready for this, it was way ahead of their time.<br></p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the <i>Cardinals of language</i> convened in a brand new library.<br><i>Grammar goons</i> waited outside with Safety pins and Clown hats.<br>
They were angry at the innate irony of the scheme, thought it to be a joke;<br>
their honor and semantics being dragged through mud. A lesson must be taught.<br>
The infidels should be ostracized from dictionaries at the least. At last,<br>
the convention decided to punish them with the <i>punishment-that-shall-never-be-given</i>.<br></p>

<p>
A huge drama followed, and the couple lived happily ever-after.<br></p>

The Director is waiting in the car.<br>
Assistant enters.<br></p>

<p>
A: Stanley, they are not laughing.<br>
S: What do you mean they aren't laughing?<br>
S: Did you hear them not laughing? It is a comedy movie.<br>
A: I know sir. But there is no laughter. Humour is hiding.<br>
S: Ridiculous, ridiculous. The script was hilarious. I wrote it.<br>
A: They are just silent sir. There is a powerful sound vacuum.<br>
S: But, I remember it was funny. Didn't it tickle your funny bone?<br>
A: Yes sir, it did tickle me.<br>
S: The actors also were hysterical during the filming.<br>
S: They had time of their life doing what I told them to do.<br>
A: Right Sir. They did laugh their bottoms up.<br>
S: Why are the audience such cretins?<br>
A: I don't know sir. But some of them even left in between the show.<br>
S: That's cold blooded comedy blasphemy!<br>
A: I couldn't take it as well sir. That's why I came out to tell you.<br>
S: Thanks Amy. Let's get out of here. Where is our driver?<br>
A: I think he inside the hall watching the movie.<br>
S: Thank goodness, at least the boy has some sense of humour.<br>
A: Sir, here he comes. In his face, I see, Sir … Satisfaction!!!<br>
S: Wonderful, Wonderful!<br></p>

<p>
Driver enters…<br></p>

<p>
S: David, Did you enjoy it?<br>
A: Tell us, how was it?<br>
D: It was relaxing. Thanks for asking.<br>
S: Thank God. All that not in vain.<br>
A: Is it over already? I thought it went for another 30 minutes.<br>
D: Sorry what? No, I finished it quickly.<br>
S: Were you not in the theater?<br>
A: Watching the movie?<br>
D: Oh, no.. no.. I was in the toilet.<br></p>

<p>
So, keeping that in mind:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a GitHub account with username 'bottle'
</li>
<li>Create a repository with the following name:'bottle.github.io'
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Instructions</a>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once done this, GitHub will host your website in the following
address(URL) : <a href="https://bottle.github.io/">https://bottle.github.io/</a>
</p>

<p>
Clone(copy) this newborn repository into your local machine a.k.a
personal computer by using the following command:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://bottle.github.io/ <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/projects/bottle
</pre></div>

<p>
You will be adding blog posts in ~/projects/bottle directory and will
push them back to GitHub later.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
If you haven't heard the news yet, Python is a programming
language and Python 3 is here to stay.
</p>

<p>
Python Virtual environment basically copies python scripts to create a
new workplace. You could install custom python packages specific to your
project. This means packages used for one project will not pollute
another project.
</p>

<p>
For e.g. if you wish to have a separate working environment for
cooking vegetables, where you don't want nikola to be installed, 
create a virtual environment called vegetables. 
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5-1" class="outline-3">

For ease of use. No need to remember too many virtualenv commands.

<p>
Let "$HOME/virenvs" be our directory for all environments.

<h3 id="sec-5-2">Steps</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
Make sure you have pip (python package manager) installed in your machine.
And follow the steps :
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenvwrapper

<p>
Fill in the form that follows.
</p>

<p>
It should show a success message after form is filled.
Now, nikola will create a new folder called bottle inside
<code>$HOME/projects/bottle</code>, which is unnecessary. So move its contents to
<code>$HOME/projects/bottle</code> folder and delete the extra bottle.
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mv my_first_site/* .
rm -r my_first_site
</pre></div>


<p>
Your new site 'bottle' can be viewed either locally or globally(using
a new technology called internet). The latter will be done later.
</p>

<p>
To view your recently created site locally, 
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nikola build
nikola serve
</pre></div>

<p>
Open browser and enter <i>localhost:8000</i> in the URL bar !

Every great software application is a file with some text in it and
<code>Emacs is a text file editor</code>
</p>

<p>
The best way to get started with Emacs is to follow its built-in
tutorial. Open Emacs and press Ctrl-h t. 
Emacs tastes best when customized. Help is available at <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/">using emacs</a>.
</p>

<p>
org-mode in itself is the biggest reason people fall in love with
Emacs so easily. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4">I like org mode introduction by Harry Schwartz</a>.
</p>

<p>
Two cool things in org-mode that I must mention:
</p>

<li>creating tables <code>|Name|Age &lt;tab&gt;</code>
